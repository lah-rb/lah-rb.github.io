As she was studied her hatred of the situation grew, she became obsessed with creating or finding a past and grew fascinated with the concept of death where the past only concerned the memory of the living. After eventually becoming released she began to frequent grave yards, turning over every head stone, so to say, to dig up the past of those left in the past. She began to encounter people who called her a grave robber. As such, run ins with the law became frequent. She used her limited flight capability in the dead of night to evade those who misjudged her, but eventually she was captured. Under protest, she was sent to the ware of the first kipuka to assist in managing the battle field’s dead once the fighting passed. The more she killed and burried, her obsession grew. She began to wear clothes with greater escentricity that honored the death that surronded her. Some began to call her the mistress of death." />
