A place where the annual high temperature rarely exceeds that of frozen water by more than a few degrees. Yet, some individuals, driven by desperation or a unique vision, seek to this place to create paradise. Over many years of settlement, new arts have sprouted amidst the barren backdrop, much like seedlings nourished by the struggles of their people. Some of these arts shape the culture, bringing joy amidst the bitter surroundings. Others shape daily life and struggle, aiming to make tomorrow a bit easier. The culmination of these artistic and technological advancements is found at the capital city's Arctechnic Institute, dedicated to advancing this free people's paradise. In one of the Arctechnic Institute's study tracks, it is customary for students and professors to periodically demonstrate their mastery of life on the frozen terrain. This practice is of great interest to those who wish to test new equipment designs, validate environmental theories, or gain a deeper understanding of their harsh surroundings. Like many adventurers, they return with stories of love and loss, of great heroics or immense tragedy. Some pack out or even adorn artifacts from their excursions as proof of their tales, exaggerated or not. Among the favored study sites are the open-pit volcanoes that dot the interior of the wasteland. These rare warm spots attract astonishing numbers of flora and fauna, drawing both researchers and traders. The most captivating creatures drawn to these volcanic oases are the seals of light (loosely translated from the local dialect). These translucent beings shimmer with an ethereal glow, their bodies pulsating with light which mirrors the lava pools below. They are entirely dependent on external sources of heat and light for survival, thriving in the unique microclimates around the volcanoes. The seals of light have become an integral part of life in this frozen landscape. Their presence is not just a testament to nature's resilience, but also a symbol of hope and adaptability for the settlers. In harsh environs, where every resource must be carefully managed, these creatures offer a sustainable solution. During expeditions, Arctechnic wonderers often carry special lanterns which cast an especially enticing volcanic glow. The seals of light find this most alluring, so they tend to gather near. At night, around campfires, the translucent bodies of the seals create a mesmerizing display of soft, dancing shadows on the snow anor ice. In modern times, traveling with seals of light has become commonplace. These translucent beings are not only a source of sustenance but also a symbol of the deep connection between the people and the area they have chosen to call home. As travelers journey through the frozen wasteland, the seals of light serve as guides, leading them to the warm oases that sustain natural life in this harsh environment.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Brox The Defiant</title><link href="https://www.kipukas.cards/brox_the_defiant/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Brox The Defiant" /><published>2024-09-20T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2024-09-20T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://www.kipukas.cards/brox_the_defiant</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.kipukas.cards/brox_the_defiant/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="slave" /><category term="bald" /><category term="ripped" /><category term="strong" /><category term="chains" /><category term="bone" /><category term="skeletal" /><category term="red" /><category term="ferocious" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some men train their bodies for the most excruitiating of physical tasks by choice, mostly to prove their exemplary masculinity. Other men have their bodies trained for them, so that they are not just a slave to their masters, but also a slave to their own body. In times past slaves were kept weak for fear of strong slaves leading a rebellion. However, due to a great equalization in power thanks to ranged weapons, great physicalliy adds little to one's personal power. Brox is one such person possessing brutal strength not by his own choice. He is no greater than a dog fighting for his master's gain and whimsy, and only feigns to the crowd a better position. However, the spirit in Brox has not diminished. He knows it is the only aspect of his life that is freely his own, and he continues on in hopes to one day serve a future brighter than his own.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Little Charm</title><link href="https://www.kipukas.cards/little_charm/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Little Charm" /><published>2024-09-20T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2024-09-20T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://www.kipukas.cards/little_charm</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.kipukas.cards/little_charm/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="anglerfish" /><category term="dark" /><category term="light" /><category term="mermaid" /><category term="ocean" /><category term="soul" /><category term="lost" /><category term="suffering" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many find fascination in dreaming of and studying monsters of the deep. However, not all monsters are born of flesh and bone. Tremondous spirits lurk amongst the depths, seeking to feast on the souls lost to the dreadful ocean tides. At first, they extend an offer of guiding hope to voyagers removed from body. An brilliant light from a little charm, visible only to the departed, percing the abyss. It entrances the souls with a promise of an end to their suffering journey, one which, in many cases, has lasted traversed for years. No previously living sapient is entirely immume to undertaking the journey or the promise of its end. When near the light, the unwilling soul experiences a great swell from behind. Possessed by abandoning fear, they grasp towards their false savior, still believeing in the object of their damnation. The swell proves too powerful to fight, and no soul, living or dead, can save them from their choices. In the end, there is Little Charm, their guide to eternal nothingness.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mutant Hide and Seek</title><link href="https://www.kipukas.cards/mutant_hide_and_seek/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mutant Hide and Seek" /><published>2024-09-20T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2024-09-20T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://www.kipukas.cards/mutant_hide_and_seek</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.kipukas.cards/mutant_hide_and_seek/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="mutant" /><category term="poem" /><category term="stench" /><category term="smell" /><category term="noise" /><category term="mishmash" /><category term="beast" /><category term="mythical" /><category term="moon" /><category term="heroine" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Diurnoct's forest, where moonbeams play, A mystical realm teems with fungal sway, Insects dance, and ruins whisper tales of old, Amidst this wonder, a nuisance growing bold.

Armed with forest knowledge, and a heart so light, She approaches the beast, on this moon-kissed night, Offering treats, and a gentle, guiding hand, Dear mishmash friend, she says, let's find a new land. The beast, surprised by kindness, true and rare, Follows the girl, with an awkward, lovable air. Beyond the forest edge, a gentle river's flow, Together they wander, through Diurnoct's glow. Until the creature finds a new home, Far, far away from the villager's moan. Beaming a grin, our heroine returns, with victory and delight, Her heart full of cheer, in the silent, moonlit night. Now the village, so sleepy, may rest its weary head, Bearing eyes, so heavy, may finaly go to bed!

Does walk among a dream of her own, or is she a mear figment. The play thing of some distant being watching her every move play out on his grand stage. Giving her subtle nudges. A left here, a right their, walk slowly around the bend. She feels like she has little control over any path she might take. Slipping into cognitave fuzz, each passing step feels a little less. A right here, a left there, lean forward against the resistance of the hill. Soon she frees in a total trance, completely uninhibited by healthy congative function. It proves to blissful to last. With her last heavy blink, her senses shock to life. A despirate, yet sweet cry wallows in the grass along her path. A small creature, familure, but oh, wildly different. A second head he had. One carefree and brash, to bring antics to her life. The other sweet and subdued, to prevent her from becoming too crude. The one with wild mane says 'Take the path forward, untold riches lie ahead'. The other, whose ears settle low, says'Take the path back, only safety is known from where you return.' Unknowning what to do the girl ponders for what feels like hours. Should I listen to you, oh free spirit, who promises a life of abondon and untold comfort. Or should I listen to you, oh cautious one, so faithful and true, offering contentment in what I already know. Like two tormenting children, their voice ring in her head, paralyzing her will to move ahead. The topic of choice circles, over and over, until she can hear of it no more. 'You only look forward, to your next thrill or your erragant desires. And you only look back, to your bitter knowledge and selfish fears. For now I am running back, but only to a new road!' She runs and runs, fighting the storms of her life. Will they catch her? No, but the monsters just might!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Orb’s Trail</title><link href="https://www.kipukas.cards/orbs_trail/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Orb’s Trail" /><published>2024-09-20T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2024-09-20T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://www.kipukas.cards/orbs_trail</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.kipukas.cards/orbs_trail/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="owl" /><category term="ghost" /><category term="trees" /><category term="forest" /><category term="dark" /><category term="lost" /><category term="soul" /><category term="guide" /><category term="wasted" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do we dream of a peaceful passing? No, most of us don't. If fact, bring up the thought of parashing and many of use fill with dread and fear. Woe so fills our hearts that we plead with whom ever may be there to spare us just another day. We then fill that day with normal activities, until we settle and forget once again the fragility of our existance. Others embrace the thought of mortality, using the idea to spur on decisions our conscious is not well fond of. You only live once after all. The fact is, no matter if we display our ignorance of death by forgetting its existance or down playing its possibility, we should all long for a peaceful passing. One where our soul can become whole and move beyond our past. Here lies the sad truth, no amout of contemplation, meditation, or foresight will ever guarentee an ideal death. Evil lurks to keep us shackeled, bewildered, and searching in this world. Keeping a ghostly presence here to echo the voice and intention of this evil.

Teachings like these make up the core foundation of the philosophy of the Causal Sophist. Generally, the reach of her ponderings is far too great for her meager, human understanding. Still, these museings take many lesser minds to places they could not dare to reach on their own. In every right, she is a genious, so few can spot the subtle flaws present in her propositions. Those who can, however, are left feeling like not much has actually been presented.

Another grueling shift was winding down, but the endless stream of diagnostic alerts refused to cease. As a Tier3 Operator for omniHolo Innovations, Rory's role was to manually splice, repair, and reboot the antiquated yet crucial hardware supporting the company's proprietary SpineNet, the backbone of the post modern internet. The air reeked of burnt circuitry and desperation. omniHolo's bean counting reluctance to upgrade the physical systems had turned her job into a never ending game of whack-a-bug. Rory's arms, clad in a tight fitting, reinforced, feed-forward smart-assist enabled holoSuite, the latest ominHolo attempt to eke out just a few more tenths of labor efficiency, moved with precision. Rory's every move now felt guided by the whims of the holographic overlays dancing across her field of vision. She had lost count of the number of times she'd patched up the same frail junctures, only for them to fail again under the crushing load of global data traffic. After all, every move you make online costs someone Watts. SpineNet's virtual architecture was a marvel, but its physical foundation was a creaky, hack job relic. omniHolo's executives preached about 'prolonged system lifespan' and 'optimized maintenance costs,' while Rory bore the brunt of their frugality. Each spark that flew from her welding torch seemed to ignite a fresh ember of frustration within her. A particularly vicious alert shrieked through the comms system, signaling yet another catastrophic failure in the 4D. Rory's response was immediate, but her movements felt mechanical, fueled by simmering resentment rather than focus. As she worked to bypass the faulty module, a thought crystallized: How many more times? The question detonated something within her. With a fierce cry, Rory hurled her welding torch aside, its glowing tip skittering across the floor. She then began to yank out bundles of wires and cables. Don't dare think she did not know what she was doing, oh no. With every pull, she surgically extracted the crucial l-amps while avoiding the life taking h-amps. Maddness crept further across her face, broad in both smile and contempt. The system's alarms screamed for once causing her pleasure, not pain.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Illia and Dorsay the Buck Skull</title><link href="https://www.kipukas.cards/illia_and_dorsay_the_buck_skull/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Illia and Dorsay the Buck Skull" /><published>2024-07-04T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2024-07-04T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://www.kipukas.cards/illia_and_dorsay_the_deer_skull</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.kipukas.cards/illia_and_dorsay_the_buck_skull/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="bat" /><category term="wings" /><category term="deer" /><category term="skull" /><category term="trees" /><category term="jungle" /><category term="creepy" /><category term="scythe" /><category term="marsh" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Illia grew up a very sick child, barely surviving from year to year. She was constantly subjected to aggressive treatments, both well known and experimental. The experience left Illia no stranger to pain and misery. Out of desperation, her parents opted to have Illia undergo an experimental gene manipulation. While the procedure went as expected, Illia did not take to the manipulation and soon after passed. She was buried under ceremony and mourned, and ultimately left to her slumber. Dorsay grew up a fawn like any other. He learned to graze, listen and watch for predators, traverse rough lands, and how to compete for the affection of does. He did not take to one of those lessons well, and met an early demise. His carcass was left to the scavengers of the forest to devour and clean. Dorsay was left in his state, a pile of bones, for a fair number of years. Illia, on the other hand, was not resting as well. Even in her state, she continued to grow, mature, and mutate. Her grave had become a cocoon, containing the spirit to eventually emerge. She awoke in a panicked state, her back mashed against the rotted boards which once made up her coffin and her face smothered in dirt. Only able to make the smallest of movements, she moved the earth bit by bit until a tunnel barely large enough for her teenaged body emerged. Arduously, she moved the tunnel steadily upward until the ground became weak enough that to break through to the surface. She emerged like a creature from a horror scene mucky from her years underground, bloody from and splintered from rubbing against her coffin, and wearing the nearly completely deteriorated and much too small cloths she carried with her from her youth. Laying crumpled on the ground half out of the hole, Illia felt a soreness between her shoulders and reach back to rub the offending spot. She emitted a loud shriek when she realized the spot was no ordinary pain. Illia was now donning a set of skin covered wings. Despite her now monstrous appearance, she still carried the heart and soul of the sweet sickly little girl who was declared deceased. She wanted to go home, but knew not where home stood. She didn't know how to get there, she couldn't remember her address, and she wouldn't know who waited in stead. Also, she realized her horrific appearance would not garnish many friends. So, she ran and hid in the nearby woods to become a local myth. The creature lurking in the shadow, stealing food from the mouths of children, and pulling lost souls underground to make them like it. Of course, these stories were imbued with various levels of exaggeration. Lurking in the shadows was pretty true, Illia was too timid to be close to visitors of the woods. She certainly did steal food, but not literally from anyone's mouth. However, pulling souls into the underworld came from one unfortunate instance where a birder walked on top of her lose soil bed and felt an her arm grab his leg. It seems Illia became too comfortable sleeping underground. Still, these events were enough to peak the interest semi-local crypto-zoologists. Given their habit of chasing indefinite creatures, the hunt for what was essentially a little girl did not last long. After so long Illia ended up in a familiar and dreaded place, a hospital. This hospital was dedicated to medical research facility looking into her not so fatal experience all the while trying to contain any rumors of walking dead roaming the forest. They treated her as somewhat inhuman, not listening anor believing her memories or explanation. They assumed she was a creature smart enough to pick up human speech patterns, but not actually of our creed. Still, they eventually figured out the mutation sequence induced into her genes and reverse engineered it. Her existence on its owned posed a question for the scientists, how permanent is death. So, they began to further mutate the gene and test it on medically dead creatures with unsustainable success. The animals would animate for a short time then rapidly deteriorate back into abyss. During these studies the measured against several levels of dead, ranging from a few minutes of death to one particularly dry deer skull all the while subjecting Illia to increasing invasive tests. Well, Illia was done with her confines. She was done with the prodding. She was done being in a place she loathed. Illia had set her sights on escape. With a well timed bite on an unsuspecting orderly, she made a ferocious dash for the exit. Using every bit of her discharm to frighten any individual willing to stand between her and freedom. While generally effective, some hospital staff sought to prove their masculinity by catching the escaping beast and impeded Illia's progress forcing her to alternate between hiding and influencing terror. Here she meet Dorsay, as well as a larger than normal stash of dead rats. She stole him, putting Dorsay on her head hoping to make the staff think the stress furthered her freakish state. The rats too were stollen, all of which were thrown at a plethora of staff. Illia eventually reached a low enough story of the hospital to break a glass window, and find in her the courage to jump. Feeling the breeze pound against her face, she now thinks of the wings she previously despised as the wings she rode to freedom. After this ordeal, Illia and Dorsay disappeared fully from their birth local. Still, people around the planet say they hear whispers from underground and above when they visit the densest forests of the region. Mutters of the conversations between Illia and here friend Dorsay.]]></summary></entry></feed>
