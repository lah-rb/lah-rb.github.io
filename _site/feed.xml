Some have seen the fearsome creatures, but few have survived when met ankle to face with the black cat. Still fewer are those born to charm, entertain, and serve the spirits within. Among these leagues are those so in tune with the beasts that they win the beasts acclaim, no that's too strong, tolerance. These enchantresses even force the creatures to mind, sorry no, occasionally sway their opinion of what needs to be done. If you have experience with these creatures, you know the terror the enchantresses must inflict to get that type of response. Meow... ahhh!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Losetany Steppes</title><link href="https://www.kipukas.cards/losetany_steppes/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Losetany Steppes" /><published>2023-12-21T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-12-21T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://www.kipukas.cards/losetany_steppes</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.kipukas.cards/losetany_steppes/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jellyfish" /><category term="landscape" /><category term="camp" /><category term="yurt" /><category term="cloud" /><category term="night" /><category term="wonderer" /><category term="ruins" /><category term="statue" /><category term="mountains" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This kipuka contains many expansive grasslands and wastelands. For the people living here, it is considered a right of passage to survive a journey carrying their village token to the wizened elder. To complete their task they must face a walk through endless miles of grasslands, followed by a guided crossing beyond the regions tallest peak, and finished with a 3 day trek trough the wastes. After setting out with unsure glee, one of the tribe's young girls, Doran, just completed the first leg of her journey after finding the guide's camp near calumniator ruinas. Almost as a sign of her inevitable success, a bloom of the Cumulon jellyfish fills the night sky. Their waving lappets give Doran the sense that the creatures want to greet her into the the next chapters of her life. As she looks upon the glowing wisps of vapor, calm and reassurance wash over Doran. Now she can prepare for the next difficult steps of her journey.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ushered Through Sabina Emporium</title><link href="https://www.kipukas.cards/ushered_through_sabina_emporium/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ushered Through Sabina Emporium" /><published>2023-12-21T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-12-21T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://www.kipukas.cards/ushered_through_sabina_emporium</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.kipukas.cards/ushered_through_sabina_emporium/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="crowd" /><category term="dragon" /><category term="skeleton" /><category term="manner" /><category term="shop" /><category term="mall" /><category term="detailed" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A battle between ancestry and heritage rages. In attempts to prove their hold on the future, fathers and sons spill the blood of each. The knowledge of what builds the future, our present, dissipates from the warriors' conscious. In its place rises the focus to triumph, skewing the edges of internal right and wrong. Before the future is lost to those with brave and foolish hearts, angels intervened with pleas for mercy. Selflessly running between the projectiles, their wives and daughters had called back the warriors' hearts to reality. The first daughter to demonstrate her courage, Sabina, died under bloody cloth. In her honor, a temple and a steeple were constructed upon the spot of her death. As often happens to grand buildings over the passing times, they become repurposed to suit the modern culture. In this case, Sabina's temple found bustling life as it transformed to its region's largest emporium. While luring to tourists, the emporium proves a glorious nest for scammers and thieves. Some find hidden jewels, archaeological treasures, or historical tomes while others find rubbish, malice, and sometimes death. Still, It has been said that when one casts their gaze to the sky beyond the vaulted glass they will feel overwhelmed with the courage of Sabina.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Balanced Inline Processing Colony</title><link href="https://www.kipukas.cards/balanced_inline_processing_colony/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Balanced Inline Processing Colony" /><published>2023-09-05T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-09-05T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://www.kipukas.cards/balanced_inline_processing_colony</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.kipukas.cards/balanced_inline_processing_colony/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="brick" /><category term="color" /><category term="chip" /><category term="computer" /><category term="lightning" /><category term="processor" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Biochemists, tasked by a group of descendants in Indochina, designed a bacterium capable of transmitting electric signals around the cell wall to their colony through the cell's pilus (hair-like appendages). These were then coxed into bacterial arrays capable of enduring higher currents. All of this was with the intent of producing full-fledged micro-processors capable of storing data without the use of any metal in order to smuggle secrets into communist China. The first iteration of the project, though prohibitively expensive, proved successful without the governments determining foul play. The agents responsible for delivering the devices proved to be the weak point of the process. Many got caught, due to repeat travel, while others were incapable maintaining the conditions sufficient for the chip's survival. Due to the touchy nature of the chip's survival, data was never captured and the project lived on. Some wonder if these colonies are capable of self awareness.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Incubation Egg</title><link href="https://www.kipukas.cards/incubation_egg/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Incubation Egg" /><published>2023-09-05T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-09-05T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://www.kipukas.cards/incubation-egg</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.kipukas.cards/incubation_egg/"><![CDATA[<div x-data="{ play_data: true }" class="z-30 w-11/12 md:w-2/3 xl:w-1/2 pb-2 place-self-center">

Hundreds of years passed with little but enormous ancestral faith to show for their desires, calls, and pleas. None lost hope, ardent and steadfast that one day they would stand rewarded. One frigged night, their leader woke from a transcendental, all consuming dream, claiming to have met the one they sought. 'A knight covered in blue. Bound by all that has past at the foot, one who sees what has never passed, and encompasses all that is now. It came. We have always known of the higher society; now I have seen it.' Many others now claim visits from the Knightsoul, and some say it has passed them edicts.
