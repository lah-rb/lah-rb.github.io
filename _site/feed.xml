These were then coxed into bacterial arrays capable of enduring higher currents. All of this was with the intent of producing full-fledged micro-processors capable of storing data without the use of any metal in order to smuggle secrets into communist China. The first itteration of the project, though prohibitively expensive, proved successful without the governments determining foul play. The agents responcible for delivering the devices proved to be the weak point of the process. Many got caught, due to repeat travel, while others were incapable maintaining the conditions sufficient for the chip's survivial. Due to the touchy nature of the chip's survival, data was never captured and the project lived on. Some wonder if these colonies are capable of self awareness.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Incubation Egg</title><link href="https://www.kipukas.cards/incubation_egg/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Incubation Egg" /><published>2023-09-05T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-09-05T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://www.kipukas.cards/incubation-egg</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.kipukas.cards/incubation_egg/"><![CDATA[<div x-data="{ play_data: true }" class="z-30 w-11/12 md:w-2/3 xl:w-1/2 pb-2 place-self-center">

      Eggs are delicious or precious, but definately vulnerable. They represent the next generation for many species and always need diligent protection. This is your task.

Hundreds of years passed with little but enormous ancestral faith to show for their desires, calls, and pleas. None lost hope, ardent and steadfast that one day they would stand rewarded.
