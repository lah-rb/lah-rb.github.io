<meta name="description" content="Many times good intentions go awry. These creatures measuring about 2 ft or 60 cm from toe to wing top were created as sentient pollinators for cultivating the berries from the regina bacarum plant. These bear berries, which have become highly prized for their sweet flavor and acclaimed aphrodisiac properties. This demand along with agricultural difficulties called for the development of the highly mobile caretaker fairy species. Small and light enough to flutter plant to plant in an expansive garden, but strong enough to defend from would be poachers. However, as demand continued to grow, the fairies suffered ever greater threats to their lives and livelihood. To defend their home, they began taming beasts of burden, to fight in their stead and under their command. This curbed the dangers for a time as most physical beings would sustain great wounds from the gnash, tusk, or claw bore upon them. Then the possessions started to occur. Fairy stole from fairy, killing the sisters and brothers that stood against them. The highest of their tribal leadership elected for great countermeasures. By altering the genetic makeup of their most promising young defenders, they created warriors of gold sensitive to and capable of excising the violent possessors. While mighty, these warriors proved to be cruel wanderers. So much as a noticed glance, may recon you for a fight." />

      Many times good intentions go awry. These creatures measuring about 2 ft or 60 cm from toe to wing top were created as sentient pollinators for cultivating the berries from the regina bacarum plant. These bear berries, which have become highly prized for their sweet flavor and acclaimed aphrodisiac properties. This demand along with agricultural difficulties called for the development of the highly mobile caretaker fairy species. Small and light enough to flutter plant to plant in an expansive garden, but strong enough to defend from would be poachers. However, as demand continued to grow, the fairies suffered ever greater threats to their lives and livelihood. To defend their home, they began taming beasts of burden, to fight in their stead and under their command. This curbed the dangers for a time as most physical beings would sustain great wounds from the gnash, tusk, or claw bore upon them. Then the possessions started to occur. Fairy stole from fairy, killing the sisters and brothers that stood against them. The highest of their tribal leadership elected for great countermeasures. By altering the genetic makeup of their most promising young defenders, they created warriors of gold sensitive to and capable of excising the violent possessors. While mighty, these warriors proved to be cruel wanderers. So much as a noticed glance, may recon you for a fight.
