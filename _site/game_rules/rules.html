                        We have put a lot of time into organizing our rules to make viewing pleasurable on a variety of
                        devices and still look good on paper. Before we dive in, let's go over navigating the rules.

                        <b>Please Note:</b> Kipukas uses many small game pieces to keep track of play. All pieces should be
                        treated as <b>CHOKING HAZARDS and the game content is for people 14+ years of age.</b>
                        Do not let children under or pets play with the pieces.
                        At all times, it is the responsibility of the legal guardians to keep all pieces out

                        Kipukas is a game which draws the best concepts from creature card games
                        and melds them with land conquering play. While I have personally enjoyed
                        playing in other competitive card based games, I grew frustrated with
                        becoming attached to certain characters, styles, and strategies only to have
                        them become re-released, competitively invalidated by the latest deck release, or
                        banned due to corporate oversight. On top of this, game companies tend to
                        produce very poor quality cards which are not meant to last, yet some manage
                        to reach unfathomable prices not worthy of the underlying paper. Kipukas
                        seeks to be different. I want Kipukas, both as a game and a durable good, to
                        outlast myself. By making cards which are updatable without new releases, we
                        keep all the cards we produce competitively relevant. Additionally, with most
                        cards produced at low rates, Kipukas challengers are much more
                        diverse. The durability of our cards as game pieces are protected by the fact
                        that we can update a broken card mechanic POST SALE. This protects your value
                        from being wasted due to our short sightedness or oversight. While most land conquering games are enjoyable as well as
                        strategically challenging, I was dissatisfied with the amount of pure luck the
                        games hinge on. By combining with the complex card v. card mechanics,
                        Kipukas battles feel more engaging, all the while retaining the larger scale
                        strategies of the land conquering play. While complex and entertaining play is
                        great, I want Kipukas to take on deep meaning and help spread it to many
                        wonderful people in this world. Kipukas will set industry standards for
                        innovative play, company interaction, and support of all whom make Kipukas awesome.
                        Lastly, I hope many find Kipukas as enjoyable as I have found my competition. Better yet, more so.

                        Kipukas is a visualization of a world where society creates new worlds as they
                        see fit. Each of these worlds are known as kipuka, which comes from the
                        Hawaiian word for 'land between lava flows', and is symbolic of the destruction
                        and rebirth of worlds. Cloning and genetic manipulation are the preferred
                        methods of populating, expanding, and manipulating the worlds. In the game,
                        the kipukas are represented by the 3D game map and the souls take life in the
                        cards. The game represents the strife to control the world, while the players
                        provide the motivation for the strife. The companion book series, Conscious
                        Territory, which takes a deep dive into these concepts, is in progress with the
                        first three chapters released and ready for reading. I have personally enjoyed
                        working the concepts and hope you will enjoy contemplating them as well.

                <p>
                    Get off to a good start and establish base camps across the board. Win fights
                    and think strategically to take your frenemies base camps and if you dare their
                    capital! Once one player claims all base camps and capitals, they dominate the
                    kipuka and win the game.

                    <h3>Pieces</h3>
                    <p>
                        Kipukas relies on oversized cards, 3d printed game pieces and game boards, and a mat for play
                        organization. We currently make all of these as a batch process in-house. The cards we produce do not include the play mechanics on the
                        card as, to my knowledge, all other card companies do. Instead, we let the artist’s
                        work be as big and beautiful as possible. In fact, we do not even let the name of the
                        card get in the way of showcasing artistic talent. Instead, we have made the play data
                        for every card we produce accessible from the QR code printed on each card's back. Technically,
                        this means the back of every kipukas card is wholy unique and identifible. However, unless you
                        can scan a QR code with your eye it probally won’t help you much. Additionally, the card art on the back
                        helps camouflage the QR from cameras at a distance making remote cheating quite difficult to say the least.

                    <h3>QR Codes</h3>
                    <p class="!text-4xl">
                        In order to make this process as user-friendly as possible, we have included a private
                        QR scanner which runs locally on your device through our web app. We, nor any other interested party, 
                        will be able to see footage caught on the QR scanner because it is never stored and never touches the internet.
                        The same cannot be said about that random QR app you installed on your phone... If you prefer to install an app we recommend the open source
                        Android app called Binary Eye as is uses the same code library as we do and is tested to work as well with some default settings changed. Cognex bar code scanner
                        is OK for iphones. <br><br>From now on we will assume that you trust us and use the QR scanner on kipukas.cards. Here, click the QR button
                        in the tool bar, accept the privacy statement, then a camera will pop up. Give the beautiful face
                        presented a gracious smile and show a card to the scanner. It will take you to that cards play data
                        page. If for some reason you need to cancel scanning, you can click the eye icon on the top left of the scanner to close it.
                        This scanner only works for QR codes which pattern match against Kipukas playing cards.
                        The scanner will work best during a game if your device does not sleep during the play through.
                        It is optional, but recommended to use or install a caffine mode app for this purpose. I hope you don't mind terrible selfies, because
                        on the following page I screenshot one to show how this works. BTW I am holding the card way too far away on purpose
                        for the shot. The QR code should take up most of the camera frame.

                        A last note about the cards. The center of the edge on the cards is colored to reflect
                        their archetypal adaptation. This is a unique feature that allows players to see what
                        type of card is on its way. Take advantage!

                        The following image shows an example of our game board, a.k.a. the map or kipuka.
                        For your convenience, it is labeled with token placement and boundary line nomenclature.

                        Note the numbers on each territory stand. This is the reference for that territory.
                        The following is an example of a mat that would be paired with the above map.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The slot numbers reference the territory numbers on the board. When cards are
                        played, they are played on these slots. Once a soul token moves between territories,
                        their corresponding card is moved from the old territory slot to the new territory slot on the
                        mat.

                            <li>Characters and Species are collectively called souls. While they have subtle play differences, when the term soul is used they play in the same manner for that context.</li>
                            <li>When a player has initiative on the turn, they take the first action (1 card played or 1 soul moved). The player without initiative takes the next action on the turn.</li>
                            <li>Kipuka (singular) refers to the 3D terrain that the game is carried out over.</li>

                            next to both players.

                            Unlock your device, turn on caffeine mode, then visit kipukas.cards (ideally on
                            a chormium based browser). Also, it is best if your device has a fully functioning front facing "Selfie" Camera

                        <li>
                            Each player declares an affinity for one archetypal adaptation for use over the duration of the game.
                            Say “The blank are my crux.” where blank is an archetypal adaptation. For example, “The
                            brutal are my crux.” See<a href="#affinity">Affinity</a>. (For a list of archetypal
                            adaptations, see <a href="#adaptation_overview">Character and Species (Soul) Cards: archetypal adaptations</a>)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To determine who places first, see if any player would prefer to place first allowing their
                            competition initiative for the first turn. If either everyone or no one wants to place first, both players roll a D6. The
                            higher roll places first while the lower roll takes initiative for the first in-game day.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            One player takes the first territory by placing their capital, the other
                            player then takes a territory with their capital. After this, each player
                            makes claims with base camps until both players have 3 territories. This
                            will leave 2 to 6 territories unclaimed, depending on the map in use.

                    <h2>Diel Cycle and Turn Advancement</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you followed along up to this point, you should now be ready to play the
                        game! Let’s go! The first 3 turns are predetermined to always be day, then night, then day to jump start the game.
                        After these, the first thing the players need to do before every turn is roll the diel die. It has faces
                        that show a sun (day), a moon (night), and lighting/wind (storm). This roll
                        dictates the actions you can take over the course of this turn, as is detailed further in this section.
                        If present, the numbers indicate the order actions are taken. <br><br>
                        While it may seem counter intuitive for night not to follow day, don't think of the diel cycle die a
                        being directly attached to hours of a day. Rather think of the roll as dictating the productivity of
                        that day.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Each diel roll, and its actions, apply to all players for that turn.</b>

                            Once you have resolved contention, if any, in your territory you may take initiative.
                            Remember, you forego your ability to take any more actions for this day by taking initiative.

                            After addressing contention, the player with initiative may place one card into play. Cards available for play during day 
                            are terrain features, traps, and souls in revealed or unrevealed position on a
                            territory you control. See <a href="#card_variations">Card Variations</a>.

                        In Kipukas there are several types of cards that compose a deck which are
                        listed below. Each variation has a section in these rules to describe their role in the game. Click or scan the QR codes
                        to see a representative member of each card type. Every card, regardless of type specifies
                        what variation it is (Card Variation), how it modifies game play (Game Effects), a class associated
                        with the number of cards that were produced (Scarcity), and a flavourful anecdote blending the card into the world (History).

                    <h2>Character and Species (Collectively Soul) Cards</h2>
                    <p>
                        These cards are the soul of Kipukas. Species cards tell the story of a species
                        as a whole, while characters tell the story of an individual within a species.
                        Until tameability is fully implemented, no playable differences between
                        character and species cards exist. Throughout this guide, we refer to these as
                        souls or soul cards when the context applies to both characters and species.
                        Most souls have the ability to move and interact with <a href="#traps">traps</a> and <a href="#items">items</a>, unless
                        otherwise stated. Each soul has an Archetypal Gene and 1 or more KEAL means made up of <a href="#adaptation">Archetypal Adaptations</a>.
                        Additionally, each soul specifies how many movement/territory stands it can traverse in a day (Movement Range), 
                        a damage tracker for KEAL means and <a href="#final_blow">Final Blow</a>s (Card Status), additional play rules (Game Effects),
                        which dice it rolls for attack and defense (Die Rolls), prefered territory type (Habitat), and a tie breaking sequence (Brawl Power).
                        <br><br>
                        We encourage you to develop story lines for your favorite cards to make the
                        game more imaginative and personal. These should be pliable details developed
                        through situational game play in order to form the soul's personality. Additionally,
                        if some detail of game strategy, like increasing the power of a dragon with a stick, seems
                        janky, you can <a href="#BS">call out</a> the move as ridiculous even if the move is otherwise valid.
                        If you learn by example better than explanation, read  the <a href="#contention_ex">Contention Resolution Example</a>
                        in <a href="#ADRH">Attack, Defense, Retreat and Healing</a>  first then reference this section as needed.
                        As interest grows, I plan on publishing play-through videos to kipukas.cards.

                    <p>
                        Each card has a unique set of qualities used in attack and defense called
                        KEAL means. These must be injured or broken to defeat the card. See
                        <a href="#ADRH">Attack, Defense, Retreat, and Healing</a>. Each part is composed of a material with
                        archetypal qualities and is influenced by the habitat of the card. By the way,
                        KEAL stands for <b>K</b>eep <b>E</b>veryone <b>AL</b>ive and emphasizes the importance
                        of every card you play.

                    <h3>Archetypal Material</h3>
                    <p>
                        KEAL means represent some physical trait or object that helps represent
                        the soul it belongs to. These are all made of some manner of matter or
                        energy, and can be thought of as materials. These materials share the same
                        archetypal adaptations presented by the <a href="#adaptation_overview">Archetypal Adaptations Overview</a>
                        which are also used for the card's Archetypal Gene. The major difference
                        between these qualities is that an Archetypal Gene represents its general adaptation, where KEAL
                        means detail the card's individual preferences/traits. Where each card only
                        has one archetypal adaptation representing its Archetypal Gene, each KEAL means may be
                        represented by 3 archetypal adaptations. These bonuses stack and counteract each
                        other, where each archetypal adaptation of the attacking KEAL means
                        interacts with each adaptation of the defending KEAL means.

                        roll modifier between KEAL means for a given attack.

                    <p>
                        <b>α mechanic</b> that applies only to species cards. Some species are easy to
                        work with while others are quite persnickety. The tameability scale represents
                        this phenomenon. Other souls and equipment may need to be played in order
                        to wrangle these species. ∞ means the species is untameable (no amount of
                        bonuses will tame them), those with 10 are the most difficult to tame,
                        while 0 means the species does not require taming.
                        A species becomes tame once player affinity and card effects stack equally with
                        the species tameability. At this point, the soul will be under the full control of the player. If the player
                        chooses to play the creature untamed or the opponent reduces your control of
                        the creature below its tameability then the creature becomes under its own
                        influence, <a href="#rouge">rouge</a>. Additionally, some cards will specify
                        an ability to be played at a lower tameability rating without going rouge.
                        In exchange, certain KEAL means or play effects will be unavaliable.
                        These can be made avaliable by staking effects equal to the tameability
                        after the species enters play.

                    <p>
                        Each day, before either player's turn, you must roll for the rouge species'
                        movement. Assign the paths connected to its current movement/territory stand, numbers 1-6.
                        Roll a D6, then move the species along the appropriate path. Repeat until it has moved its entire Movement Range.
                        Movement is the responsibility of the of the person whom originally played the rouge.
                        If the territory it moves into is occupied by souls you or your
                        frenemy controls, it must attack all souls (for both players) in the territory until it looses once. Rouges
                        can move into and attack souls within either players capital.<br><br>

                        Players engage in <a href="ADRH">contention actions</a> (attack, retreat, or reinforce) against rouges like 
                        they do against their opponent. You can also enter an agreement with your opponent to attack rouges
                        in a certain order anor obstain from attacking each other until the rouge is defeated.
                        Trading cards in hand is acceptable for these negotiations (You hand cannot have more than 3 cards, no exceptions!)
                        Dishonesty in these agreements is entirely possible, so be careful. Souls on the top of the card stack will be attacked first.<br><br>

                        If a rouge defeats all soul cards in the
                        territory, remove the claim token on the territory. Rouge species must roll
                        against trap and terrain feature cards when applicable, then reap
                        consequences as well as benefits. Rouges must be revealed. Failure to
                        do so will result in an immediate victory for the opposite player. If a rouge
                        manages to defeat a player by defeating all souls in their capital while they control no base camps,
                        the other player must defeat or tame the rouge soul. Failure to do so will result in a dual defeat.

                        Either player can attempt to tame a rouge soul and bring it under their
                        control. This will require boosting player affinity higher than the tameability
                        of the species card using items and the player’s base affinity level. This is the same
                        manner that species which require taming are placed normally. Taming will occur
                        at the begining of the day before contention is resolved. It is first avaliable to the
                        player with initiative. The player who attempts taming must have a fully controlled soul
                        <b>already</b> in the same territory as the rouge soul.

                        In certain circumstances, i.e. loitering (more than 1 day) in your opponent's capital, and under the effect of certain
                        cards, souls can be taken prisoner. In this state the souls resides in the basecamp/capital in the territory where the prison is located
                        and is unable to be played by the card's owner. Territories can support a max of 3 prisoners. This is in addition to the 3 souls per player normally supported.
                        It will remain in the imprisoned state until it is liberated by meeting the conditions
                        listed on the prison play effect or (if unspecified) the basecamp/capital is taken from the opponent. And yes, that means your loitering
                        soul will likely be imprisoned in the capital for the entire game. However, some cards will have play mechanics that allow for imprisoned
                        souls to be sprung.

                        The ultimate goal of affinity is to be a long term game play strategy alongside
                        loyalties attached to the soul cards. When we attach a game server to the Kipukas binder
                        , you will be able to track your affinity for playing with 
                        <a href="#adaptation_overview">Archeptypal Adaptations</a>. As you declare them at
                        the start of a game, your affinity for them will grow. 
                        Likewise, loyalty will increase a with the number of times
                        that you play the specific card soul card. (Both will be limited to once per day, except at
                        tournaments, which will be once per match.) Loyalty will also increase if you
                        came to own the card through an incubation card. When loyalty, affinity, and play
                        effect bonuses stack greater than the species card's tameability, the
                        card will be tamed. Until our webapp is further developed, there will not be a
                        loyalty or affinity tracker. In its place, players will add 1 to attack and defense rolls
                        made for their declaired Archetypal Affinity.

                    <p>
                        In order to defeat a soul, you must first weaken them by injuring or breaking
                        their KEAL means. This is accomplished by attacking with your soul’s
                        KEAL means. Each soul has a certain KEAL means tolerance that it
                        can take before becoming vulnerable to a <a href="#final_blow">Final Blow</a>.
                        Modifiers are applied based on the KEAL means being used.
                        See <a href="#keal_means">Character and Species (Soul): KEAL Means</a>.
                        After an unsuccessful blow, the player loses their ability to
                        attack with that card for this diel cycle. On the defender's next turn, they
                        must choose to attack or retreat. If an effect says souls take X damage, then
                        the damage will apply to either the KEAL means or the <a href="#final_blow">Final Blow</a>. If it
                        applies to the <a href="#final_blow">Final Blow</a>, the card becomes wasted and is <a href="#discarding_runout">discarded</a>

                    <h3>KEAL Means Damage, Healing, and Tolerance</h3>
                    <p>
                        As souls accrue injuries (lose KEAL means), their tolerance for new injuries
                        becomes smaller. Injuries usually occur one at a time, but some can inflict
                        multiple at once. See below for an <a href="#contention_ex">example</a>. Some can even defeat souls
                        without contest under the correct conditions. Injuries should be noted on the
                        KEAL Means Damage Tracker on the card's page on kipukas.cards. When any card's
                        KEAL means count reaches the last number, they become downed. This means they can't
                        take any more punishment and become vulnerable to being engaged in a final
                        attack. If the card either survives a <a href="#final_blow">Final Blow</a> or is not engaged in a final
                        attack, it won't be able to engage in attacks. As well, its movement speed is
                        halved until it is healed. See <a href="#moving_downed_souls">Maps (The Kipuka): Movement: Moving Downed Souls</a>.
                        If a soul is caught exposed during a storm they will lose one KEAL
                        means or if they are downed they will be wasted.
                        <br><br>
                        Souls can be healed by other souls, terrain features, or items with a healing
                        ability. The soul must be within the same territory as the healing entity or within its specified
                        healing range. Healers can only heal a certain number of KEAL means with
                        in a certain number of diel cycles. Most healers have the ability to heal
                        themselves under the same conditions mentioned above, unless they are
                        downed.

                        attack uses the same dice as the cards use for KEAL means, but compares the cards' 
                        <a href="#archetypal_gene">Archetypal Gene</a> rather than a chosen KEAL means. Additionally, each cards' fundamental
                        <a href="#motivation">motivation</a> may help them conquer or live to see a new day. If the attack is

                        wasted. See <a href="#discarding_runout">Discarding Cards and Deck Runout</a>.

                        If an attack results in a tie (the values of the attack and defense dice rolls,
                        after modifiers are applied, are equal) or the mini-game does not result in a clear winner,
                        the souls will engage in a brawl. In order to complete a brawl,
                        both players need to look at their soul's 4 digit brawl sequence. The brawl
                        sequence consists of letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores. In order to
                        determine the victor, players compare the characters from left to right

                        This applies to all tied rolls involving cards in contention, namely KEAL means and final rolls.
                        By the way, brawl sequence are generated for every card at random. So an otherwise strong card can
                        have a very weak brawl and weak cards can brawl hard.

                    <h3>Retreat and Reinforce</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you are in a badly losing fight, retreating might prove beneficial. It can allow
                        you to regroup and redeploy to a more favorable position while minimizing loss. Players may retreat souls
                        individually or as a group to a movement/territory stand(s) after their opponent's attack is stopped or after a soul is wasted, but before
                        launching a counterattack. <br><br> The stand must be within the max Movement Range of the slowest card in the group.
                        For example, if you are retreating 2 cards in a group, one with a Movement Range of 3 and the other with a Movement Range of 1,
                        you can only retreat both cards to a distance of 1 away for a group retreat. Once you state where you are retreating to,
                        the opposing player decides if they let you go, or they challenge the escape. If the opposing player wishes to
                        prevent the escape, the escapee must win a roll of 2 D6 against a D20
                        for the retreating party. If retreating souls individually, you roll for the success of each retreat in the same manner. Also, your opponent
                        might challenge any number of retreats they wish or let some souls go without challenging the retreat. <br><br>
                        If successful, move your party to the nearest base camp or
                        movement stand in territory that you control. Partial retreats are allowed.
                        Downed souls may only retreat under escort of a soul with 1 or more KEAL means. For the retreat,
                        they move at the max movement of the escort. Afterwards, they move at the speed of the downed soul.
                        See <a href="#moving_downed_souls">Moving Downed Souls</a>. If unsuccessful, the retreating soul(s) 
                        forgo their ability to attack for the day.

                    <h3>Retreat and Reinforce</h3>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, if the situation is looking grim, but you don't want to lose the fight you
                        can move souls into the conflict. This can occur in two ways. The first requires moving souls
                        from nearby uncontended territory. This occurs with the same timing as a retreat (after
                        an attack or after a wasted soul, but before counter attack) except the they are allowed
                        join the mess without rolling to enter. Additionally, if two territories are under contention
                        near one another you can retreat a soul or group from one conflict to another by executing a successful
                        retreat roll then moving the soul or party of souls into the other contended area.

                    <h3>Scenario Walkthrough</h3>
                    <h3 class="!text-5xl"><b>Combat Setup</b></h3>
                    <p>
                        In the above examples, we have our character, Hilbert, locked in battle with
                        a species card called the Myrthvither Raven. The
                        defending card's (Hilbert) archetypal adaptation matches the player's declared affinity,
                        so the card receives a bonus to all rolls made by the card. The first attack
                        launched will be a KEAL means attack. The habitat of this card is forest
                        and the battle, according to the geography, is taking place in a forest. This
                        gives the defender a bonus to each KEAL attack made in this territory.
                        Unfortunately, the defender is a nomad, which neutralizes this bonus.
                        Don't worry we will get back at the opponent.
                        In this case, neither cards habitat's secondary effect kicks in.
                        Next, each player chooses a KEAL means and writes it on their grease
                        board. On the count of three, players reveal their choice to one another at the same time.
                        These will be the keal means used for the remainder of this contention.

                    <h3>Scenario Walkthrough</h3>
                    <h3 class="!text-5xl"><b>Defense</b></h3>
                    <p>
                        Hilbert will use his Majestic Beak to defend against the Raven's Symbiont Barrage.
                        Each <a href="keal_means_DHT">KEAL means</a> is chosen by the cards owner, and lasts for all combat between these
                        souls on this day. The bonus will need to be determined using the <a href="#fists_tool">fists tool</a> on kipukas.cards
                        anor using the provided typing table guide if you perfer an arduous manual check.
                        A key thing to note is that each type has a different effect on the other type's
                        attack power. This adds or subtracts up to three points from the roll PER TYPE INTERACTION. This can really influence
                        the result of the bout. As an extreme example, if a Cenozoic-Decrepit-Angelic KEAL means is pitted against a Decript-Angelic-Brutal
                        KEAL means it will recieve a crushing -13 to its roll. If it only rolls 2 D6 (quite common for cards with effects) it is an instant loss.
                        However, in Hilbert's case the attack die modifier decreases the raven's attack roll by 5. If
                        the attack wins (which it has a miserable chance of acomplishing), the defender’s (Hilbert) KEAL
                        means count is reduced by one and the attacker has the opportunity to push
                        on and attack again. This continues until the attacker loses, chooses to stop
                        the attack, or the defenders KEAL means count drops to 0. Hilbert rolls with 2 D6 dice
                        where as the Myrthvither Raven rolls with only 1 D6. This coupled with the type
                        advantage of Hilbert's KEAL means ensures his victory in this defense. So,
                        the turn ends for the attacker.

                    <h3>Scenario Walkthrough</h3>
                    <h3 class="!text-5xl"><b>Retreat, Reinforce, or Counter Attack</b></h3>
                    <p>
                        Now Hilbert has several options. If he is worried about the raven recieving reinforcements
                        he can opt to retreat by winning a dice throw. Additionally,
                        if Hilbert has friendly souls nearby now would be the time they join in on the fun and reinforce Hilbert's attack.
                        See <a href="#retreat">Retreat and Reinforcement</a>.
                        However Hilbert is feeling his kingly confidence and thinking about all the loving he will recieve as a war hero,
                        so he is going to attack the Myrthvither Raven alone. Normally, this would involve the reverse
                        role of the previous scenario, but the Myrthvither Raven is special. It modifies how the opponent
                        can engauge it at the expense having 0 KEAL means. This means if it losses once, it is wasted.
                        In order to face the Myrthvither, Hilbert must successfully roll the standard trap detection to find
                        the raven. Assuming this is successful the raven will likely be defeaded due to being weak compared
                        to the almighty King Hilbert. The raven is a mear scout in the prescence of greatness after all. If, by some
                        miracle of play and strategy the Myrthvither Raven actually manages to beat Hilbert's roll, the current territory
                        will remain under contention, but the fighting will resume the next day with the player who claims initiative attacking first.
                        Alternatively, either Hilbert or the raven can be attacked by a reinforcing soul moved into the territory during this day.

                    <p>
                        Here we could easily assume the raven was wasted on Hilbert's counter offensive. However;
                        let's pretend that the Myrthvither Raven is now equipted with some item that gives it one additional
                        KEAL means to lose. This would mean that it is now downed and vulnerable to the <a href="#final_blow">Final Blow</a>.
                        Now Hilbert engages in the Final Blow. Given that both cards have the Avian archetypal adaptation
                        neither is at a disadvantage since adaptations of the same type usualy do not interact.
                        Additionally, neither motive has an advantage against the other. However; the Myrthvither Raven is in the
                        Support preservation triad <a href="#motivation">motivation</a> which would give it a bonus of 3 to it's
                        final defense roll. Hilbert's motivation is in the Self preservation triad, which turns all his final blows engagements, including this one,
                        to best 2 out of 3. So Additionally, Passion and Satisfaction do not interact, Hilbert does not recieve the +10 bonus.
                        If the Final Blow is successful (in this case twice in 3 rolls), (which is likely given the relative power of each) then
                        the defender normally gets wasted and moves out of play. See <a href="#discarding_runout">Discarding Cards and Deck Runout</a>.
                        If at any point the sum of the rolls and bonuses were tied, the battle
                        match would end with a <a href="#brawl">brawl</a>. Let's assume the raven recieves it's final miracle and ties
                        with Hilbert thereby starting a brawl. When we compare the value of Hilbert's HMPU, to the Myrthvither Raven's ZrrD.
                        we see that Hilbert triumps with a capital H over a capital Z. The battle is won, now Hilbert can return to his kingly 
                        diggs and reap the spoils of his victory! (or the game will contiune on, just don't tell him that!)

                    <p>
                        These cards modify <a href="#maps">territory</a> either to benefit or hinder souls in the area.
                        Some may be placed at random anywhere on the board, while others may
                        offer controlled placement. These may target your opponent's territory claims,
                        your territory claims, unclaimed territories, or any territory regardless of
                        status. Only one terrain feature can be in play on a territory at a time.
                        Unless otherwise specified, a new terrain feature played in a territory will
                        replace the terrain feature card currently in play on the territory. Some of
                        these cards must be revealed because their effects are instant and continuous.
                        Unless stated otherwise, most terrain features are revealed at the discretion of
                        the claim owner. If a territory is claimed with an unrevealed terrain feature,
                        it becomes revealed to the new owner. These cannot be moved by a
                        soul.

                    <p>
                        Some cards apply an effect to a territory via a method of random selection. In
                        order to properly select this territory, roll a D20 (or a D12 if you own any). If
                        the number rolled is within the highest number on the board, then apply the
                        effect to that territory. Otherwise, re-roll until the roll is less than or equal to
                        the highest territory number. Alternatively, a random number generator is a
                        good fit here. There are a bunch of free ones that you can use if you prefer

                <h2>Trap Cards</h2>
                Lay these in territories to activate as entities move between and through
                territories. These require a reasonable soul to lay them unless stated
                otherwise on the card. Upon moving a soul into a territory with
                frenemy unrevealed cards, traps must first be rolled against to see if any are
                activated. If the trap is activated via the conditions listed in the trap card's
                description, then apply its effects against the enemy attacker on top of the
                card stack. If the trap is not sprung, check the roll to determine if the trap is detected.
                If detected, remove from play; otherwise, the trap will attempt to activate as
                the enemies move through the territory where it is placed. Most traps activate
                on a D20 roll, which is why players must always roll when entering a territory
                under with opposing unrevealed cards. Traps are detected if a 1,2,3, or 4 is
                rolled. Some cards may have the ability to change these numbers, so
                be careful! Once laid, these cards can be moved by a soul unless otherwise
                stated. They remain unrevealed during movement.

                <h2>Sabotage Cards</h2>
                <p>
                    Play these cards under the cover of night and mess with your opponent's next
                    turn. Sabotage card effects can target a wide variety of play aspects, from
                    temporarily disabling mechanical souls to blowing up terrain features.
                    Sabotage cards can only be played once a night. Their effects are usually
                    applied to the next day roll; however, cards can change this if specified.
                    Unlike most other cards in Kipukas, the effects of sabotage cards tend to be
                    fixable under specific conditions or after a certain number of turns. Also,
                    sabotage cards have a higher likelihood of success when compared to traps.
                    Unlike traps; however, sabotage cards have consequences for the player who
                    attempted the sabotage if they fail. This can be anything from jailing souls for
                    a number of turns to wasting the soul who attempted to plant the explosive.
                    As such, these cards have three aspects important to game play: Success
                    Criteria, Successful Sabotage Result, and Failure Consequence. Typically,
                    sabotage cards will state rolling a D20 against two D6 as the activation
                    criteria.

                    <h2>Item Cards</h2>
                    <p>
                        These cards are used in crafting. Crafting provides potions, equipment, and
                        other boosters. A single item will have far less power (or no power) than a
                        crafted item. The more items used in a craft, the more powerful
                        the final crafted item will be. Unless otherwise stated, items can be moved
                        unrevealed by souls. Generally, if an effect or attack with an equipped item
                        fails, you may try that effect or attack again during the next diel cycle. If a
                        crafted item emulates another card type (i.e. trap card, soul card, etc.) please
                        review the respective section on how to play the <a href="#recipes">recipe</a>. Items and crafted items
                        are generally not destroyed, but rather dropped when a soul equipped with them is
                        wasted. If a territory is under contention when this happens, each
                        player chooses a suitable card to attempt to grab the item. A KEAL means
                        bout will ensue where the victor equips the item and the loser takes KEAL
                        means damage. See <a href="#ADRH">Attack, Defense, Retreat, and Healing</a>.
                        If only one player has a suitable soul(s), the opponent can only defend the
                        dropped item, not equip it. If neither player has a suitable soul in the
                        territory, the dropped item is ignored until a suitable soul move into the
                        conflict or the contention is resolved.

                    <h3>Crafting</h3>
                    <p>
                        Crafting occurs at night, when a player combines two to three item cards according to a
                        <a href="#recipes">recipe</a>. If a crafting recipe is being guessed (competitors
                        and refs can tell you if you are correct) and the guess is wrong, then
                        immediatly discard the items involved in the guess. Once an item is crafted, you can keep the cards together to
                        represent that item, or if you prefer, you can submit the recipe to Kipukas
                        then purchase a single card representation of the crafted item when available.
                        <br><br>
                        Crafted items may enhance cards from other categories or produce cards from
                        other categories. Once applied to a card, an enhancement can be moved or
                        removed, unless otherwise specified. Crafting character cards is the only way to
                        have more than a single copy of a character in your deck, but you can only
                        have one natural character card and one crafted character card. There will be no
                        exceptions to this rule. Once an item is crafted, it either needs to be used
                        according to the recipe's description or hidden on a controlled territory (max
                        1 per territory). To use hidden items, you simply pull the item from the
                        territory and craft as normal. If a territory is taken which contains hidden
                        items, the items must be revealed unless protected by a different active card.
                        Control of the revealed cards, while in play, is given to the new claim holder.
                        The claim holder must then decide to use, hide the items again, or discard the
                        items to the card owner's discard.

                    <h3>Equip Items to Souls</h3>
                    <p>
                        Items are often able to equip to a soul to increase some aspect of the card's
                        abilities. Items are equipped the night they are crafted or during the day
                        as a part of the movement phase. Equipped items may transfer between souls if
                        they occupy the same territory/movement stand. Equipped
                        items are allowed to be unequipped. If a player decides to do this, the item (crafted or not)
                        stays revealed in the territory which they were unequipped. Unlike hidden items, there is no limit to the number
                        of revealed unequipped items in a territory. If a crafted item is unequipped, the item remains in its crafted state and
                        the cards remain together in a stack. A reasonable soul under the control of either player
                        may pick up and equip these items provided they are in the uncontested territory. When crafted or uncrafted
                        items are equiped to a soul, move all cards together as a stack

                        Crafting recipes must be discovered and kept for reference later. In
                        competition, recipes maybe guessed and confirmed by event refs or
                        competitors. If confirmed, you may use the recipe in the match. Only one
                        recipe can be used in this fashion. Normally, you present the recipe from your
                        recipe deck to the other player to prove you can play the item combo. <br>
                        
                        During our founders period, we have released all recipe combinations that are
                        possible to make with the founder's deck items. Additionally, we have made a page
                        on kipukas.cards to demonstrate how this mechanic works. You can find it under the
                        menu in the tool bar. In the future, we plan on making these into recipe cards as well
                        for players to incorperate into their broader recipe deck. However, these recipes will
                        always be accepted a competitions as open use and the online demonstration will always
                        reside on the kipukas binder.

                <p>
                    We don't condone stealing another player's card out of game. However, if you
                    would consider such a thing, I doubt you care what we think. Despite this, we
                    are more than happy to encourage stealing in game! Cards will tell you to
                    steal either from your opponent's hand, deck or either. You might be able to
                    steal the cards revealed or unrevealed, depending on the instruction of the
                    card. Either way, you begin by declaring whether you will steal from your
                    opponent's hand or deck. Then your opponent will fan out the cards you have
                    chosen, either facing them (unrevealed) or you (revealed). Then you pick the
                    card that you fancy and place it in your hand. If the card allows for stealing
                    revealed, you CANNOT scan the opponent's cards to make your decision in
                    competitive play. For friendly play, handle that as you like. Most
                    IMPORTANT, you CANNOT gain more than 3 cards in your hand from
                    stealing. This is completely forbidden in Kipukas. If your stealing move would
                    result in you taking more than 3 cards it is cancled and in compatition discarded. 
                    It should go without saying that stolen cards return to their original owners at the end
                    of the game. The other options are gambling or actual thievery, in either case
                    you should consult your local laws on the legality of your behavior.

                <p>
                    Once a card becomes wasted, it is discarded into a pile and cannot be played
                    again. However, some card effects target the cards in either player's discard enabling their reemergence. If you run
                    out of cards before the end of the game, don't worry, you have not lost yet.
                    You may continue using the cards you have in play on the kipuka. If both
                    players run out of cards, either may still manage to take all the remaining
                    territory even without cards in hand. Here they would win under standard
                    conditions. Otherwise, play until no characters or species 
                    (including <a href="#rouge">rouge species</a>) are left on the kipuka. At this point, the players stop contention
                    under a forced peace and hold convention. Here they discuss how to proceed

                        and ready to play. The player who had the last soul on the kipuka states whether they

                    It is worth while to note that if both parties are in total agreement to keep the peace
                    this it is fully acceptable at compatitions.
                    If an agreement can't be reached within a few minutes, just rage-quit, because
                    the other person must be pretty insufferable. Why were you playing a game
                    with them in the first place?

                    <h2>Building Decks</h2>
                    <p class="!text-4xl">
                        Decks are built gradually in Kipukas. To keep barriers to entry as low as
                        possible we offer a starter kit that includes a starter map (changes by season),
                        a starter deck or two of your choice (at first only the founder's deck is
                        available, but more archetypal adaptation specific starter decks will be
                        produced), and two sets of tokens. Growing your deck after you purchase a
                        starter kit (or if you are ambitious, before ever purchasing one) involves
                        purchasing other starter decks separately, purchasing individual cards from
                        kipukas.com, purchasing and waiting out the incubation period for incubation
                        cards, or trading with people that you trust. Kipukas cards are valuable
                        pieces of fine art, as such we take their trade and resell seriously. You can
                        request any sell or trade to be brokered through Kipukas. A brokered trade
                        will involve both parties sending their cards to Kipukas. Each card in the
                        trade will be authenticated using our 7 factor authentication process. If all
                        cards involved in the trade are presumed authentic, we will complete the trade
                        and send the cards to their new owners. If any cards are found to be
                        inauthentic the trade will be canceled, the authentic cards will be returned to
                        their owners and the inauthentic cards will be retained by Kipukas. This
                        process protects your information as neither party gets to know the other’s
                        address while protecting you from counterfeit cards. Kipukas will also put
                        cards that you want to trade, sell, or auction on our website and inform you
                        of offers as they are made. Keep watch for Kipukas Trade Deals, where we
                        offer an exceptional trade from time to time (frequency increases as customer
                        base builds). <br>
                        As for recipes, you can submit a request for the recipe card with your next
                        order. Recipes also act as information that players can trade. Standardly, one
                        recipe is given out with the purchase of three cards or three recipes with the
                        purchase of one starter pack. If a certain recipe is requested in the order
                        notes, it will replace one of the random recipes you would have received.

                    <h3>Incubation Cards</h3>
                    These cards can be purchased, traded, won or given away just as all the other
                    card types; however, these cannot be played. Instead, they represent an
                    incubation time which, when complete, allows them to be traded for a soul with an increased
                    loyalty. See <a href="#affinity">Affinity</a>. The longer the incubation
                    period, the rarer the card Kipukas will send to you. The prices of these cards
                    are lower than the equivalent character or species available for purchase. Also,
                    incubation cards allow access to the rarest card categories, normally reserved
                    for competition winners and special event giveaways, if you are willing to wait
                    out a long incubation period. The number of these cards is fixed for each
                    category, so when they sell out, you will have to wait until one of the
                    incubation cycles completes in order to incubate a soul of your own. For the
                    unparalleled and winners circle rarity cards, you will be allowed to request a
                    Archetypal Gene. If you wish, you may also submit an artist’s rendition of the card
                    with a backstory, then request that the card be incubated. It is not a
                    guarantee that it will be produced; however, it may be considered.

                    <h2>Maps (The Kipukas)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Maps are 3D representations of territory and control. Each map hosts stands
                        that represent traveling time and 8 to 12 territories that represent control.
                        Each territory can host a max of 3 souls. In each
                        territory there are stands for soul tokens and stands for base camp or capital
                        tokens. Soul tokens represent the position of a revealed soul, while square
                        base camps and capitals act as points of entry for new souls, a place for
                        revealed or unrevealed souls to stay, and represent control of a territory
                        Capitals act the same as base camps, but are particularly important to game
                        play because your opponent will not be able to take your capital until they
                        take all other territories on the board. Territories also represent opportunities
                        or dangers for souls which typically dwell in or avoid the geography. See
                        <a href="#habitat">Character and Species (Soul) Cards: KEAL Means: Habitat</a> and
                        <a href="#geography">Maps (The Kipukas): Geography</a>. For
                        competition purposes, only Kipukas produced boards are allowed. We do encourage
                        adding adornments and personal flair to show off!

                    <h3>Movement</h3>
                    <p class="!text-4xl">
                        Each territory contains slots for placing base camp tokens and soul tokens.
                        When a card enters the map it starts at one of the player controlled base
                        camps or their capital, either unrevealed or revealed, dependent on the
                        player's choice. Cards cannot be moved in the same day they were played
                        unless stated otherwise. As it becomes strategically advantageous, each player should choose to move their souls in
                        play. This can be done by following the lower lines which connect between the
                        circular movement stands and the square territory stands. Every territory hosts
                        a max of 3 souls (per player), and each soul has a finite number of spaces which it can
                        traverse. When a soul moves, the card is placed on the mat slot with the
                        same number as the territory moved into. In order to move, you must reveal
                        the soul unless the card says otherwise. If an enemy is on the same stand that you moved to, you must
                        engage an attack. Also, you cannot move past an enemy waiting on a
                        movement slot unless a card effect permits doing so. See <a href="#ADRH">Attack, Defense, Retreat, and Healing</a>;
                        otherwise, read <a href="#claiming_territories">claiming territories</a> below if you just moved
                        on to a territory stand. 
                        <br><br>
                        If a revealed soul is in a base camp, then no soul token is used. If the
                        soul is currently on a movement stand, a soul token is used to represent this.
                        If more than one soul is on the same movement stand, stack the individual
                        tokens to represent the group. If you have two souls in the same territory on
                        different movement stands, flip a soul token over and declare which soul is
                        represented by that token. If your soul moves back into a base camp, then
                        keep the card revealed, but remove its soul token from the board. With the exception of being
                        totally destroyed, capitals cannot be taken until all other base camps are taken. However, your opponent's
                        souls can move though capitals without entering contention. If your opponent leaves a soul in your capital
                        for more than 1 day after arriving, the capital takes the soul prisoner. See <a href="#prison">Character and Species (Souls): Imprisoned Souls</a>

                    <h3>Transit Territories</h3>
                    <p>
                        If a territory only contains movement stands it is a transit territory. This occurs due to the difficulties required
                        building within the territory, figuratively speaking. A good example is a
                        territory filled with water. See <a href="#geography">Maps (The Kipukas): Geography</a> for
                        more information about water movement. These locations are clearly labeled
                        on the mat as 'transit territory', so cards moved within should be placed
                        accordingly.

                    <h3>Claiming Territories</h3>
                    <p>
                        In order to win the game, you must first claim territories. To claim territories,
                        you must move at least one soul into the base camp of the territory you wish
                        to claim. If it is empty, congrats, you have a new base camp! Place a base
                        camp token on the square stand, then continue your turn. Otherwise, if the
                        territory has a claim on it, you must oust your opponent by defeating their
                        traps, terrain features, and souls before you can replace their claim with your
                        own. See  <a href="#contention">Contention</a> next. There is no limit to the number of territories that
                        can be claimed in a single day. If you think you can take all territories,
                        including the opposing player's capital, in a single day, go for the win!
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section id="contention">
                    <h3>Contention</h3>
                    <p class="!text-4xl">
                        If a frenemy's soul enters territory controlled by opposition (with the exception of the capital), the territory
                        comes into contention. Under contention, players must perform the card
                        activation sequence. See <a href="#card_activation">Card Activation</a>.
                        Card effects often activate when you enter frenemy territory and are triggered by
                        a D20 roll, so always roll when entering contested territory. You will
                        need to contend with their traps and terrain features before attacking revealed
                        souls.
                        <br><br>
                        In order to claim the territory, you must take the base camp by moving
                        a soul onto the territory stand and alleviate contention on that stand. If your opponent has any revealed souls in
                        the territory you moved into, all opposing souls will need to leave the territory
                        before contention on the whole territory is relieved. This means you will not be able to take possession
                        of the traps and terrain features in said territory until your opponent has no souls remaining in the territory,
                        even if you have taken the base camp. If your opponent has
                        multiple enemies on a stand, you can attack one or all (one at a time) of
                        the enemies on the stand. If you decide to stop your attack or if you lose an attack,
                        your opponent will either choose to counterattack, <a href="#retreat">retreat or reinforce</a>. If their
                        counterattack stops before all your souls are defeated, on the following day, you
                        have the option to continue the fight or retreat and move out of the space. You can also reinforce the conflict.
                        See <a href="#ADRH">Attack, Defense, Retreat, and Healing</a>.
                        <br><br>
                        If you are not successful in taking the territory, your opponent is not
                        obligated to reveal entities, traps, or terrain features unused in its defense.
                        Once your opponent has exhausted all of their defense options, and you move
                        a soul into the base camp, you should replace their base camp token with
                        your base camp token. At this point all terrain features and items must be
                        revealed then control of the cards, while they are in play, is transferred to the
                        victor. Traps still roll activation/detection for their original player; however,
                        if detected the new territory owner can take control of the trap instead of disabling it.
                        See <a href="#traps">Trap Cards</a>.

                    <h3>Geography</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each territory has a geography that corresponds to the map's topography.
                        This geography offers habitat effects for the soul cards in the territory.
                        See <a href="#habitat">Character and Species (Soul) Cards: KEAL Means: Habitat</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the boat(s) marking the water habitats, Kipukas maps use
                        docks to represent the points that souls can embark onto boats. 
                        Boats are played from the hand at docks. Boats can ferry a specified number of souls
                        a given distance over a day. Once launced they can make land and be embarked from the last spot they landed.
                        Either player may use a boat landed in an uncontended spot. Cards may attempt to
                        swim by rolling 2 D6. If you roll 2 + 2 the card has successfully swum. It no longer needs
                        to roll to continue swimming until it exists the water.
                        Attempting to swim does not cost movement, but can only be attempted once
                        per soul per day. You can attempt to swim by traversing any path leading to water.

                <h2>Game Mats</h2>
                <p>
                    Mats connect a soul card's position with the soul token's position on the map.
                    This makes game play more comfortable by organizing the game space.
                    Kipukas will have a set of mats, but will encourage community development
                    and artist support with regard to producing more engaging and creative mats.
                    Make them as personal as you wish. The only production guidelines are as follows:
                    <br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The number of section slots must be greater than or equal to the number of territories.</li>
                        <li>Territory reference numbers must be included and visable both with and without cards.</li>
                        <li>A transit territory space must be allocated on the mat.</li>
                    </ul> <br><br>
                    The standard mat size that Kipukas produces is 17" by 24". If you create a map design you feel really
                    represents a facet of Kipukas, you can submit your creations to us. If we like it, you have a good
                    we will consider producing it and providing a commission for the design.

                    <p class="!text-4xl">
                        There is a lot going on in this game. Along the way, we will make mechanics that conflict on a
                        reasonability level. My personal favorite example is a dragon wielding a stick
                        to boost its attack. That is all sorts of wrong. If your opponent attempts to
                        make a move that simply makes no sense, you have the right to contest
                        it. The following is how you do so:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Call them out before the effect is used in game play</li>
                        <li>Pause the contention and hold convention (have a talk)</li>
                        <li>One player must concede reasonability (either for or against)</li>
                        <li>if required, enlist a tie breaking third individual to make the final call</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p class="!text-4xl">
                        Yes, it is definitely a lot to learn at first. Kipukas is a game that rewards
                        repeated play with ease. The more you can play the game, the better you will
                        know the card mechanics of your deck, the turn structure, and the interactions between the
                        pieces. The overall plan is to progressively create tools to aid
                        players in keeping track of their game. Either way, we try our best to make
                        this rules set as comprehensive and digestible as possible. When possible, we
                        will post videos to clarify game play aspects and intent of the mechanics. In
                        all, don't worry about capturing every aspect of this game. As I stated, there
                        is a lot going on. Have fun with it, make house rules, and we are always open
                        to suggestions. These rules are geared for a future with competitions where
                        everything will be scrutinized. At this point, don't get too bogged down and
                        just find a way to play that is fun for you and your friends.

                            The player with the most territory

                            addition it imposes a soul defeat limit that if hit removes the player

                            After a fixed number of diel cycles, the player with the most

                            type defeated receives a +3 bonus) wins. Both players must have an
                            agreed number of those types in their decks. The huntable cards must
                            be played and cannot be discarded. Additionally, an overall deck size
                            must be agreed upon.
