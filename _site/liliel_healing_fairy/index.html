By adding wings, these so named fairies are capable of short distance flight which aids them in transversing difficult terrains. Unlike Mihela, Liliel considers Mihela a sister despite neither having a natural mother. Liliel studied to become a doctor after her release from the program.

There she worked as a field medic attempting to keep natural born and created alive through brutal fighting. She carries a blunt edged sword intended to push her foes far enough away to escape via flight. She tries to kill only when threatened with eminuate death." />
