<meta name="description" content="Hilbert started life out as any other avian frog; living it up in the tree tops among the bogs of their small remote kipuka. He rose to the position of king not by might in war, clever politics, or birth right. Instead, hilbert bred with his colony prolifically earning him the most estemed position. Under his reign, the avian frogs were ushered into unparalled prosperity thanks to the establishment of bug farms. The staff he holds has been passed down throgh countless kings. The most devoted of the frogs believe it harnesses the mystery and power of the moon." />
