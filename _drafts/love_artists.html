        Cards are pieces of fine art and every aspect must reflect form as much as it reflects function.
        All cards and the processes used to manufacture them, must offer an exceptional lifetime goal 100+ years when treated as a display piece.
        Works may be leased from the owners once printed.
        T-shirts, Boards, etc. are acceptable for reproducing the image (artists choice)
