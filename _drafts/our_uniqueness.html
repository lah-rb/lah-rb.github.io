      <h2 class="mt-6 font-bold">Insurance</h2>
      <p class="z-20 w-5/6 md:w-4/6 place-self-center">
        We cannot reprint damaged cards, but we can attempt repair. If the card is beyond repair, we will provide a 25% off coupon good for one card of equal scarcity. If more than 4 cards in 6 months are submitted through insurance claims, the excess claims will need to be resolved through case procedures.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-6 font-bold">Open</h2>
      <p class="z-20 w-5/6 md:w-4/6 place-self-center">
