        Subscribe for a fate of three on monthly new releases. You never know what you will get, because we have not made it yet!
        Rework rarity for sanity and less artificial scaricity using seasonal releases and disney vault like rereleases for the cards that did not sell our printings in their season
        
        All cards and the processes used to manufacture them, must offer an exceptional lifetime goal 100+ years when treated as a display piece. They also must be able to be repaired by experts if damaged. T-shirts, boards, mats, marketing material may require the reuse of art work used as card content. If so, the artists who own the work will be paid as outlined in the Kipukas Loves Artists contract. Also as outlined in the contract, the art work will never be used to produce more cards than the original run.
