While I have personally enjoyed playing in other competitive card based games, I grew frustrated with becoming attached to certain characters, styles, and strategies only to have them become re-released, competitively invalidated by the latest deck release, or banned due to corporate oversight. On top of this, game companies tend to produce very poor quality cards which are not meant to last, yet some manage to reach unfathomable prices not worthy of the underlying paper. Kipukas seeks to be different. I want Kipukas, both as a game and a durable good, to outlast myself. By making cards which are updatable without new releases, we keep all the cards we produce competitively relevant. Additionally, with most cards produced at low rates, Kipukas challengers are much more diverse. The durability of our cards as game pieces are protected by the fact that we can update a broken card mechanic POST SALE. This protects your value from being wasted due to our short sightedness or oversight. While most land conquering games are enjoyable as well as strategically challenging, I was dissatisfied with the amount of pure luck the games hinge on. By combining with the complex card v. card mechanics, Kipukas battles feel more engaging, all the while retaining the larger scale strategies of the land conquering play. While complex and entertaining play is great, I want Kipukas to take on deep meaning and help spread it to many wonderful people in this world. Kipukas will set industry standards for innovative play, company interaction, and support of all whom make Kipukas awesome. Lastly, I hope many find Kipukas as enjoyable as I have found my competition.

In the game, the kipukas are represented by the 3D game map and the souls take life in the cards.

It can allow you to regroup and redeploy to a more favorable position while minimizing loss. Players may retreat souls individually or as a group to a movement/territory stand(s) after their opponent's attack fails or is stopped or after a soul is wasted, but before launching a counterattack.   The stand must be within the max Movement Range of the slowest card in the group. For example, if you are retreating 2 cards in a group, one with a Movement Range of 3 and the other with a Movement Range of 1, you can only retreat both cards to a distance of 1 away for a group retreat. Once you state where you are retreating to, the opposing player decides if they let you go, or they challenge the escape. If the opposing player wishes to prevent the escape, the escapee must win a roll of 2 D6 against a D20 for the retreating party. If retreating souls individually, you roll for the success of each retreat in the same manner. Also, your opponent might challenge any number of retreats they wish or let some souls go without challenging the retreat.   If successful, move your party to the nearest base camp or movement stand in territory that you control. Partial retreats are allowed. Downed souls may only retreat under escort of a soul with 1 or more KEAL means. For the retreat, they move at the max movement of the escort. Afterwards, they move at the speed of the downed soul. See Moving Downed Souls. If unsuccessful, the retreating soul(s) forgo their ability to attack for the day. Additionally, if the situation is looking grim, but you don't want to lose the fight you can move souls into the conflict. This can occur in two ways. The first requires moving souls from nearby uncontended territory. This occurs with the same timing as a retreat (after an attack fails, soul is wasted, or the opponent stops attacking, but before counter attack) except the they are allowed join the mess without rolling to enter. Additionally, if two territories are under contention near one another you can retreat a soul or group from one conflict to another by executing a successful retreat roll then moving the soul or party of souls into the other contended area."},{"id":"contention_ex","title":"An Example Combat Round ( Contention Resolution )","text":"This is our old friend hilbert!

The defending card's (Hilbert's) archetypal adaptation matches the player's declared affinity, so the card receives a bonus to all rolls made by the card. The first attack launched will be a KEAL means attack. The habitat of this card is forest and the battle, according to the geography, is taking place in a forest. This gives the defender a bonus to each KEAL attack made in this territory. Unfortunately, the defender is a nomad, which neutralizes this bonus. Don't worry we will get back at the opponent. In this case, neither cards habitat's secondary effect kicks in. Next, each player chooses a KEAL means and writes it on their grease board. On the count of three, players reveal their choice to one another at the same time. These will be the keal means used for the remainder of this combat. Defense# Hilbert will use his Kings's Mojo (his only choice) to defend against the Raven's Symbiont Barrage. Each KEAL means is chosen by the cards owner, and lasts for all combat between these souls on this day. The bonus will need to be determined using the fists tool on kipukas.cards anor using the provided typing table guide if you perfer an arduous manual check. A key thing to note is that each type has a different effect on the other type's attack power. This adds or subtracts up to three points from the roll PER TYPE INTERACTION. This can really influence the result of the bout. As an extreme example, if a Cenozoic-Decrepit-Angelic KEAL means attacks a Decript-Angelic-Brutal KEAL means it will recieve a crushing -13 to its roll. If it only rolls 2 D6 (quite common for cards with effects) it is an instant loss. However, in Hilbert's case the attack die modifier decreases the raven's attack roll by 6 (decrepit to angelic -1, decrepit to avian -2, decrepit to energetic +1, arboreal to angelic +2, arboreal to avian -3, arboreal to energitic -3 sumed together equal -6). If the attack wins (which it has a miserable chance of acomplishing), the defender’s (Hilbert's) KEAL means becomes injured and the attacker has the opportunity to push on and attack again. This continues until the attacker loses, chooses to stop the attack, or the defenders last KEAL means becomes injured. Hilbert rolls with 2 D6 dice where as the Myrthvither Raven rolls with only 1 D6. This coupled with the type advantage of Hilbert's KEAL means ensures his victory in this defense. So, the turn ends for the attacker. Retreat, Reinforce, or Counter Attack# Now Hilbert has several options. If he is worried about the raven recieving reinforcements he can opt to retreat by winning a dice throw. Additionally, as long as Hilbert has friendly souls nearby they join in on the fun and reinforce Hilbert's attack. See Retreat and Reinforcement. However, Hilbert is feeling his kingly confidence and thinking about all the loving he will recieve as a war hero. He is going to attack the Myrthvither Raven alone. Normally, this would involve the reverse role of the previous scenario, but the Myrthvither Raven is special. It modifies how the opponent can engauge it at the expense having no tolerence to KEAL means injury. This means if it losses once, it is wasted without going to final bout. In order to face the Myrthvither, Hilbert must successfully roll the standard trap detection to find the raven. Assuming this is successful the raven will likely be defeaded due to being weak compared to the almighty King Hilbert. The raven is a mear scout in the prescence of greatness after all. If by some miracle of play and strategy (like powering it up with an item first) the Myrthvither Raven actually manages to beat Hilbert's roll, the current territory will remain under contention. In this case, the fighting will resume the next day with the player who claims initiative attacking first. Alternatively, either Hilbert or the raven can be attacked by a reinforcing soul moved into the territory during this day. Clutching Victory# Here we could easily assume the raven was wasted on Hilbert's counter offensive. Instead, let's pretend that the Myrthvither Raven is now equiped with some item that gives it one additional KEAL means to lose. This would mean that it is now downed and vulnerable to the Final Blow. Now Hilbert presses the attack and engages in the Final Blow. Given that both cards have the Avian archetypal adaptation neither is at a disadvantage since adaptations of the same type do not interact. Additionally, neither motive has an advantage against the other. However, the Myrthvither Raven is in the Support preservation triad motivation which would give it a bonus of 3 to it's final defense roll. Hilbert's motivation is in the Self preservation triad, which turns all his final blows engagements, including this one, to best 2 out of 3. Because Passion and Satisfaction do not interact, Hilbert does not recieve the +10 bonus to the attack roll. If the Final Blow is successful (in this case twice in 3 rolls), then the defender normally gets wasted and moves out of play. See Discarding Cards and Deck Runout. If at any point the sum of the rolls and bonuses were tied, the battle match would end with a brawl. Let's assume the raven recieves it's final miracle and ties with Hilbert thereby starting a brawl. When we compare the value of Hilbert's HMPU, to the Myrthvither Raven's ZrrD. we see that Hilbert triumps with a capital H over a capital Z. The battle is won, now Hilbert can return to his kingly diggs and reap the spoils of his victory!

Unlike most other cards in Kipukas, the effects of sabotage cards tend to be fixable under specific conditions or after a certain number of turns. Also, sabotage cards have a higher likelihood of success when compared to traps. Unlike traps; however, sabotage cards have consequences for the player who attempted the sabotage if they fail. This can be anything from jailing souls for a number of turns to wasting the soul who attempted to plant the explosive.

Items and crafted items are generally not destroyed, but rather dropped when a soul equipped with them is wasted. If a territory is under contention when this happens, each player chooses a suitable card to attempt to grab the item. A KEAL means bout will ensue where the victor equips the item and the loser takes KEAL means damage. See Attack, Defense, Retreat, and Healing. If only one player has a suitable soul(s), the opponent can only defend the dropped item, not equip it.

Crafting character cards is the only way to have more than a single copy of a character in your deck, but you can only have one natural character card and one crafted character card. There will be no exceptions to this rule. Once an item is crafted, it either needs to be used according to the recipe's description or dropped in a controlled territory (max 1 per territory). To use dropped or hidden items in a craft, you simply pull the item from the uncontended territory and craft as normal. If a territory is taken which contains unrevealed dropped items, the items must be revealed. Control of the revealed cards, while in play, is given to the new claim holder.

To claim territories, you must move at least one soul into the base camp of the territory you wish to claim. If it is empty, congrats, you have a new base camp! Place a base camp token on the terrain stand, then continue your turn. Otherwise, if the territory has a claim on it, you must oust your opponent by defeating their souls in the territory before you can replace their claim with your own. See Contention next. There is no limit to the number of territories that can be claimed in a single day. If you think you can take all territories, including the opposing player's capital, in a single day, go for the win!"},{"id":"contention","title":"Contention","text":"When souls controlled by opposing players occupy the same territory, it is contested. When moving causes contention, players must perform the card activation sequence. See Card Activation. Card effects often activate when you enter frenemy territory, and are triggered by a D20 roll. So, always roll when entering opposing territory with unrevealed cards. You will need to contend with their traps and terrain features before attacking revealed souls.   In order to claim the territory, you must take the base camp by moving a soul onto the territory stand and alleviate contention on that stand. If your opponent has any revealed souls in the territory you moved into, all opposing souls will need to leave the territory before contention on the whole territory is relieved. This means you will not be able to take possession of the traps and terrain features in said territory until your opponent has no souls remaining in the territory, even if you have taken the base camp. If your opponent has multiple enemies on a stand, you can attack one or all (one at a time) of the enemies on the stand. If you decide to stop your attack or if you lose an attack, your opponent will either choose to counterattack, retreat or reinforce. If their counterattack stops before all your souls are defeated, on the following day, you have the option to continue the fight or retreat and move out of the space. You can also reinforce the conflict. See Attack, Defense, Retreat, and Healing.   If you are not successful in taking the territory, your opponent is not obligated to reveal entities, traps, or terrain features unused in its defense. Once your opponent has exhausted all of their defense options, and you move a soul into the base camp, you should replace their base camp token with your base camp token. At this point all terrain features and dropped items must be revealed then control of the cards, while they are in play, is transferred to the victor. Traps still roll activation/detection for their original player; however, if detected the new territory owner can take control of the trap instead of disabling it. See Trap Cards."},{"id":"geography","title":"Geography","text":"Each territory has a geography that corresponds to the map's topography. This geography offers habitat effects for the soul cards in the territory. See Character and Species (Soul) Cards: KEAL Means: Habitat. In addition to the boat(s) marking the water habitats, Kipukas maps use docks to represent the points that souls can embark onto boats. Boats are played from the hand at docks. Boats can ferry a specified number of souls a given distance over a day. Once launced they can make land and be embarked from the last spot they landed. Either player may use a boat landed in an uncontended spot. Cards may attempt to swim by rolling 2 D6. If you roll 2 + 2 the card has successfully swum. It no longer needs to roll to continue swimming until it exists the water. Attempting to swim does not cost movement, but can only be attempted once per soul per day. You can attempt to swim by traversing any path leading to water."},{"id":"geo_markers","title":"Representation of Geography on the Kipuka","text":"Mountain Habitat: A-Frame House Geomarker  Forest Habitat: Log Cabin Geomarker  Plains Habitat: Ranch House Geomarker  Volcanic Habitat: Modern House Geomarker  Water Habitat: Boat Geomarker  Underground Tunnel: Connect territories and shorten travel for underground dwellers  Water Habitat: Dock Geomarker (Point of Entry)"},{"id":"mats","title":"Game Mats","text":"Mats connect a soul card's position with the soul token's position on the map. This makes game play more comfortable by organizing the game space. Kipukas will have a set of mats, but will encourage community development and artist support with regard to producing more engaging and creative mats. Make them as personal as you wish. The only production guidelines are as follows: \nThe number of section slots must be greater than or equal to the number of territories.\nTerritory reference numbers must be included and visable both with and without cards.\nA transit territory space must be allocated on the mat."},{"id":"BS","title":"Challenging BS","text":""},{"id":"story_challenging_your_opponent","title":"Story Challenging Your Opponent","text":"There is a lot going on in this game. Along the way, we will make mechanics that conflict on a reasonability level. My personal favorite example is a dragon wielding a stick to boost its attack. That is all sorts of wrong. If your opponent attempts to make a move that simply makes no sense, you have the right to contest it. The following is how you do so: \nCall them out before the effect is used in game play\nPause the battle and hold convention (have a talk)\nOne player must concede reasonability (either for or against)\nif required, enlist a tie breaking third individual to make the final call"},{"id":"hard","title":"This Game is Hard!","text":"Yes, it is definitely a lot to learn at first. Kipukas is a game that rewards repeated play with ease. The more you can play the game, the better you will know the card mechanics of your deck, the turn structure, and the interactions between the pieces. The overall plan is to progressively create tools to aid players in keeping track of their game. Either way, we try our best to make this rules set as comprehensive and digestible as possible. When possible, we will post videos to clarify game play aspects and intent of the mechanics. In all, don't worry about capturing every aspect of this game. As I stated, there is a lot going on. Have fun with it, make house rules, and we are always open to suggestions. These rules are geared for a future with competitions where everything will be scrutinized. At this point, don't get too bogged down and just find a way to play that is fun for you and your friends."},{"id":"playstyleoptions","title":"Play Style Options","text":"Domination:Winner controls all territory in the kipuka. (Standard play style covered in this guide) Mass conflict:Domination with up to 4 players on a standard kipuka. (8 territories = 2 player max, 9-11 territories = 3 player max, 12 territories = 4 players max or starting territories are limited to 1 capital and 1 base camp) At competitions expedition boards will be available for play and purchase that will accommodate many (read a lot, gross, giant boards) more players. Same rules as Domination, but more parties means a tougher fight and more decks than are available via a starter kit at the moment. Band together:Players must work together to defeat a third party (i.e., ref, celebrity player, autonomous party, etc.), The player with the largest number of spaces held wins. If the third party dominates the kipuka then both players lose. King of the hill:A territory is selected either randomly or by a ref that must be claimed and held for a certain number of diel cycles to meet the victory condition. Players start with only a capital in adjacent territories. Captive:Each player gives the other a soul card, which they shuffle into their deck. Once drawn, the player must play the card unrevealed. The first player to reveal and lead their soul back to their capital wins Highest body count:Territory claims do not matter. Capitals cannot be taken. The game ends when either player runs out of cards. The victor is the player that managed to defeat the most soul cards. A number of soul cards and total card limit should be agreed upon except at competition where deck building strategy is a sizable component in this style of play The ends must justify the means:The player with the most territory gained to souls lost after a fixed number of diel cycles wins. The cost is too great:This uses standard Domination rules, but in addition it imposes a soul defeat limit that if hit removes the player from the game. Coastal war:The player to control the most coastline after a fixed number of diel cycles is the victor. The hunt:After a fixed number of diel cycles, the player with the most territories plus the hunt bonus (player with most souls with a certain type defeated receives a +3 bonus) wins. Both players must have an agreed number of those types in their decks. The huntable cards must be played and cannot be discarded. Additionally, an overall deck size must be agreed upon. Find the treasure (Special at competitions):A ref secretly marks a space on the board with an item card, the first player to claim that space wins the match and receives the item card. Players start with only a capital in adjacent territories. Explorer (special at competition):A ref secretly marks a space on the board with a terrain feature, the first player to claim that space and successfully use the card against their opponent wins the match and receives the terrain feature card. Players start with only a capital in adjacent territories. Trap Springer (special at competition):A ref secretly marks a space on the board with a trap card, the first player to set off the trap in that space wins the match and receives the trap card. Players start with only a capital in adjacent territories. Off to the rescue (special at competition):A ref secretly marks a space on the board with a soul card, the first player to claim that space and usher the survivor back to their capital wins the match and receives the soul’s card. Players start with only a capital in adjacent territories Cradle Robber (special at competition):A ref secretly marks a space on the board with an incubation card drawn from a bag, with scarcity proportional to the incubation cards in circulation. The first person to find and take the surrounding sections (thereby protecting the card) wins the match and receives the incubation card. Players start with only a capital in adjacent territories."}]
