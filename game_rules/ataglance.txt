Welcome to Kipukas! I am glad you want to quickly start playing the game without getting overwhelmed by the details. Here's a quick guide to help you get started:

    Gather your game pieces: Map, game board, tokens, dice, and cards. Make sure you have everything needed for a two-player game.
    Declare your affinity: Choose one archetypal adaptation for your character during setup. This choice affects gameplay throughout the match.
    Determine who places first: Players can choose to place their capital second or roll a D6 to decide. Whoever places second gets initiative for the first in-game day.
    Place capitals and base camps: Both players take turns claiming three territories by placing their capital and base camps. Leave 2-6 unclaimed territories depending on the map.
    Set up your hand: Each player draws three cards from the top of their deck. Keep in mind that you can never have more than three cards in your hand at any given time.
    Start the game: Begin on the turn of the player who placed their capital second. Follow the predetermined order of day, night, and storm cycles for the first three turns. Afterward, each turn starts with rolling the diel die which determines available actions.
    Day Actions: Use movement range to traverse territories, engage in battles, play terrain features, traps, or souls. You can also reveal an unrevealed entity or move 1 soul to adjacent spaces within their movement range. Remember to address any existing conflicts before taking initiative.
    Night Actions: Draw cards to fill your hand back to 3, craft items, play sabotage cards, or take initiative for the next diel cycle.
    Storm Actions: Roll to determine whether a storm occurs. If so, any exposed card not under a base camp/capital takes damage and may become removed from play.
    Card Variations: Familiarize yourself with different types of cards such as characters, species (collectively called 'souls'), terrain features, traps, items, etc. Each variation has specific roles and effects in the game.
    Attack, Defense, Retreat & Healing: Defeat opponents by targeting their KEAL means through dice rolls modified by various factors including material, habitat, archetypal adaptations, motivations, and brawl sequences. Retreat if necessary, reinforcements can join combat too. Heal injured souls using healers or items.
    Final Blow: Once a soul's KEAL means count maxes out, they enter a final blow state. Winning this requires defeating the enemy's Archetypal Gene and Motivation type in a roll-off.
    Terrain Features & Traps: Modify territories using these cards strategically. Some target frenemy claims while others offer controlled placement. Only one feature per territory can be in play at once.
    Sabotage Cards: Play these under cover of night to disrupt your opponent's next turn. Effects vary widely but typically involve disabling mechanical souls or destroying terrain features.
    Item Cards: Craft potions, equipment, and boosters using item cards. Equipped items transfer between souls when they occupy the same territory/movement stand. Unequipped items remain revealed in territories until picked up again.
    Personal Effect Cards: Played at the beginning of the game, these add abilities for use throughout. If no effect card is owned or preferred, default options apply.
    Stealing Cards: Legally ""steal"" cards from your opponent's hand or deck according to certain conditions specified in card instructions.
    Discarding Cards & Deck Runout: Wasted cards are discarded into a pile and cannot be played again. Recipes allow crafting new items. Running out of cards doesn't mean immediate loss; continue using those still in play until no more characters or species are left on the kipuka.
    Building Decks: Starter kits include starter maps, decks, and tokens. Expand your collection via additional purchases, incubation cards, trades, or recipe cards. Maintain a 30-card + 1 optional personal effect card minimum. No more, no less.
    Maps (The Kipukas): Understand the 3D representation of territory and control represented by stands and slots for placing base camps and soul tokens. Movement lines connect circular movement stands to square territory stands.
    Game Mats: Connect soul card positions with corresponding soul token positions on the map using provided mats. Create custom mats if desired, adhering to size guidelines.

This should give you a solid foundation to begin playing Kipukas. As you continue to delve deeper into the game mechanics, don't forget to refer back to the comprehensive rulebook whenever necessary. Good luck, and enjoy exploring the world of Kipukas!

Before You Begin

    Safety First: All game pieces are choking hazards. Suitable for players 14+ years old.
    Device Setup: Ensure your device has a functioning front-facing camera and consider using a chromium-based browser for optimal QR scanner performance on kipukas.cards.

Quick Start Steps
1. Game Setup

    Place the 3D map on the mat's outlined square.
    Each player declares an Archetypal Adaptation affinity (e.g., ""The brutal are my crux."").
    Determine who places first:
        Mutual agreement grants initiative to the second player.
        Otherwise, both players roll a D6; the higher roll places first, and the lower roll gets initiative.

2. Initial Placement

    The first player places their Capital on any territory.
    The second player places their Capital on any unclaimed territory.
    Players alternately claim territories with Base Camps until each has 3 territories.

3. Deck Preparation

    Place your Personal Effect Card (or use the default) in front of you.
    Respectfully Shuffle each other’s decks (slide cards, don’t bridge).
    Each player draws 3 cards (maximum hand size).

4. Gameplay Overview

    Turn Structure: Day, Night, Storm (determined by Diel Die roll after the first 3 predetermined turns).
    Actions:
        Day:
            Resolve contention in your territory.
            Play a card or move a soul.
            Optionally reveal a soul or place a Base Camp.
        Night:
            Optional: Move hand to deck bottom, draw to refill hand, craft items, play sabotage, or take initiative for the next day.
        Storm:
            All exposed cards take KEAL means damage or are wasted if downed.

5. Key Mechanics

    KEAL Means & Final Blow: Weaken a soul’s KEAL means to force a Final Blow, which pits Archetypal Genes against each other.
    Contenion Resolution:
        Activate traps and terrain features.
        Engage in combat (dice rolls modified by Archetypal Adaptations and Habitat).
        Resolve with a brawl if tied.
    Rogue Species: Move automatically at the start of each day, attacking all souls in the territory they move into.
    Imprisoned Souls: Captured souls are held in the opponent’s base camp/capital, unable to act until liberated.

6. Winning Conditions

    Claim all territories, including your opponent’s Capital.
