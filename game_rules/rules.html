                        We have put a lot of time into organizing our rules to make viewing pleasurable on a variety of

                        and still look good on paper. Before we dive into the rules lets go over navigating the rules.

                        Kipukas is a game which draws the best concepts from creature card games
                        and melds them with land conquering play. While I have personally enjoyed
                        playing in other competitive card based games, I grew frustrated with
                        becoming attached to certain characters, styles, and strategies only to have
                        them become re-released, competitively invalid by the latest deck release, or
                        banned due to corporate oversight. On top of this, game companies tend to
                        produce very poor quality cards which are not meant to last, yet some manage
                        to reach unfathomable prices not worthy of the underlying paper. Kipukas
                        seeks to be different. I want Kipukas, both as a game and a durable good, to
                        outlast myself. By making cards which are updatable without new releases, we
                        keep all the cards we produce competitively relevant. Additionally, with most
                        cards produced at extremely low rates, Kipukas challengers are much more
                        diverse and play mechanics are protected from having to be changed due to
                        our oversight. While most land conquering games are enjoyable as well as
                        strategically challenging, I was dissatisfied with the amount of pure luck the
                        games hinge on. By combining with the complex card v. card mechanics,
                        Kipukas battles feel more engaging, all the while retaining the larger scale
                        strategies of the land conquering play. While complex and entertaining play is
                        great, I want Kipukas to take on deep meaning and help spread that to many
                        wonderful people in this world. Kipukas will set industry standards for
                        innovative play, company interaction and support of fan base, and
                        environmental impact. Additionally, I hope many find Kipukas as enjoyable as
                        I have found my competition. Better yet, more so.

                        Kipukas is a visualization of a world where society creates new worlds as they
                        see fit. Each of these worlds are known as kipuka, which comes from the
                        Hawaiian word for 'land between lava flows', and is symbolic of the destruction
                        and rebirth of worlds. Cloning and genetic manipulation are the preferred
                        methods of populating, expanding, and manipulating the worlds. In the game,
                        the kipukas are represented by the 3D game map and the souls take life in the
                        cards. The game represents the strife to control the world, while the players
                        provide the motivation for the strife. The companion book series, Conscious
                        Territory, which takes a deep dive into these concepts, is in progress with the
                        first three chapters released and ready for reading. I have personally enjoyed
                        working the concepts and hope you will enjoy contemplating them as well.

                <p>
                    Get off to a good start and establish base camps across the board. Win fights
                    and think strategically to take your frenemies base camps and if you dare their
                    capital! Once one player claims all base camps and capitals, they dominate the
                    kipuka and win the game.

                        Kipukas relies on cards, small game pieces, a game board, and a mat for play and
                        organization. The cards we produce do not include the play mechanics on the
                        card as, to my knowledge, all other card companies do. Instead, we let the artist’s
                        work be as big and beautiful as possible. In fact, we do not even let the name of the
                        card get in the way of showcasing artists talent. Instead, we have made the play data
                        for every card we produce accessible from the QR code printed on their back.

                        In order to make this process as user-friendly as possible, we have included a private site only
                        QR scanner which runs locally on your device on our web app. At kipukas.cards click the QR button
                        in the tool bar, accept the privacy statement, then a camera will pop up. Give the beautiful face
                        presented a gracious smile and show a card to the scanner. It will take you to that cards play data
                        page. If for some reason you need to cancel scanning, you can click eye in the top left of the scanner to close it.
                        This scanner only works for QR codes which pattern match against kipukas playing cards.
                        The scanner will work best during a game if your device does not sleep during the play through.
                        It is optional or recommended use or install a caffine mode for this purpose. Keeping your
                        device
                        plugged in during the game is also recommended. I hope you don't mind terrible selfies, because
                        I screenshot one to show how this works. BTW I am holding the card way too far away on purpose
                        for the shot. The QR code should take up most of the camera frame.

                        A last note about the cards. The center of the edge on the cards is colored to reflect
                        their archetypal adaptation. This is a unique feature that allows players to see what
                        type of card is on its way. Take advantage!
                        <br><br>
                        Kipukas uses many small game pieces to keep track of play. All pieces should be
                        treated as <b>choking hazards for children and pets!</b> Do not let children under
                        3 years of age or pets play with the pieces, especially unsupervised.
                        When play has concluded, it is the responsibility of the legal guardians to keep
                        the pieces safely organized in the box and the box out of reach of children and pets.

                        The following image shows an example of our game board, a.k.a. the map or kipuka.
                        For your convenience, it is labeled with token placement and boundary line nomenclature.

                        Note the numbers on each base camp stand. This is the reference for that territory.

                        The slot numbers reference the territory numbers on the board. When cards are
                        played, they are played on these slots. Once a soul token moves between territories,
                        their corresponding card is moved from the old territory slot to the new territory slot on the
                        mat.

                            Say “The blank are my crux.” where blank is an archetypal adaptation. For example, “The
                            brutal are my
                            crux.” (See <a href="#affinity">Affinity</a> for more information) (For a list of archetypal

                            If either everyone or no one wants to place first, both players roll a 6 sided die. The

                            places first and takes their turn second within a diel cycle roll for the duration of the

                            makes claims with base camps until both players have 3 territories. This
                            will leave 2 to 4 territories unclaimed, depending on the map in use

                        that show a sun (day), a moon (night), and lighting (storm). This roll
                        dictates the actions you can take over the course of this turn (one player’s
                        actions during the diel cycle), as outlined below. Numbers indicate the
                        sequence of actions.

                    <h2>Character and Species (Collectively Soul) Cards</h2>
                    <p>
                        These cards are the soul of Kipukas. Species cards tell the story of a species
                        as a whole, while characters tell the story of an individual within a species.
                        Until tameability is fully implemented, no playable differences between
                        character and species cards exist. Throughout this guide, we refer to these as
                        souls or soul cards when the context applies to both characters and species.
                        Most souls have the ability to move and interact with traps and items, unless
                        otherwise stated. (See <a href="#traps">Trap Cards</a> and <a href="#items">Item Cards</a> for
                        more information)
                        We encourage you to develop story lines for your favorite cards to make the
                        game more imaginative and personal. These should be pliable details each
                        player develops through play in order to form the soul’s personality. If you
                        learn by example better than explanation, read Typing summary and example
                        below first and check our website kipukas.us for game play through videos
                        which I will post as interest grows.

                    <h2>KEAL Means</h2>
                    <p>
                        Each card has a unique set of qualities used in attack and defense called
                        KEAL means. These must be injured or broken to defeat the card. (See
                        <a href="#ADR">Attack, Defense, and Retreat</a> for more information) If a KEAL means
                        becomes injured/broken, then the card which did so may not attack that
                        KEAL means until it becomes healed. Other souls may; however, attack
                        the injured KEAL means. Each part is composed of a material with
                        archetypal qualities and is influenced by the habitat of the soul. By the way,
                        KEAL stands for <u>K</u>eep <u>E</u>veryone <u>AL</u>ive and emphasizes the importance
                        of every card you play.

                    <h3>Archetypal Material</h3>
                    <p>
                        KEAL means represent some physical trait or object that helps represent
                        the soul it belongs to. These are all made of some manner of matter or
                        energy, and can be thought of as materials. These materials share the same
                        archetypal adaptations presented in the soul type chart. The major difference
                        is that a card’s soul type represents its general adaptations, where KEAL
                        means specify the card’s individual preferences/traits. Where each card only
                        has one archetypal adaptation in its soul type, each KEAL means may have
                        up to three archetypal adaptations. These bonuses stack and counteract each
                        other, where each archetypal adaptation of the attacking K. E. A. L. means
                        interacts with each adaptation of the defending K. E. A. L. means.

                        on habitat. Bonuses are applied to KEAL means bouts. See the next page for
                        habitat types and effects also see <a href="#geography">Maps (The Kipukas): Geography</a>.

                    <p>
                        α mechanic that applies only to species cards Some species are easy to
                        work with while others are quite persnickety. The tameability scale represents
                        this phenomenon. Other souls and equipment may need to be played in order
                        to wrangle these species. 9 means the species is untameable (no amount of
                        bonuses will tame them) while 0 means the species does not require taming.
                        A species becomes tame once player affinity and effects are applied. At this
                        point, the soul will be under the full control of the player. If the player
                        chooses to play the creature untamed or the opponent reduces your control of
                        the creature below its tameability then the creature becomes under its own
                        influence. See Rouge Species below. Additionally, some cards can be played at
                        a lower tameability rating without going rouge. However, not all of their
                        KEAL means or play effects will be available for use at the lower affinity.
                        Instead, they will require a higher player affinity to use these awesome
                        abilities.

                    <p>
                        Each day, before either player’s turn, you must roll for the rouge species’
                        movement. If the territory it moves into is occupied by souls you or your
                        frenemy controls, it must attack all souls in the territory until either it or its
                        enemies within the territory are defeated. Either player can choose to attack
                        either a rouge soul or the other player’s souls during their normal or both
                        should they have the cards to do so during their normal turn. Souls on the
                        top of the card stack will be attacked first. If it defeats all soul cards in the
                        territory, remove the claim token on the territory. Rouge species must roll
                        against trap and terrain feature cards when applicable, then reap
                        consequences as well as benefits. Rouge entities must be revealed. Failure to
                        do so will result in an immediate victory for the opposite player. If a rouge
                        soul manages to defeat a player, the other player must defeat or tame the
                        rouge soul. Failure to do so will result in a dual defeat.

                    <h3>Taming Rouge Species</h3>
                    <p>
                        Either player can attempt to tame a rouge soul and bring it under their
                        control. This will require boosting player affinity higher than the tameability
                        of the soul using items and the player’s base affinity level. This is the same
                        manner that species which require taming are placed normally. Taming occurs
                        at the begining of the day cycle, before either player makes other moves.

                    <h2>Affinity</h2>
                    <p>
                        The ultimate goal of affinity is to be a long term game play strategy alongside
                        loyalties attached to the soul cards. When a full Kipukas phone application is
                        developed, your affinity for certain types will increase as you declare them at
                        the start of a game. Likewise, loyalty will increase a with the number of times
                        that you play the soul card. (This is limited to once per day, except at
                        tournaments, which will be once per match.) Loyalty will also increase if you
                        came to own the card through an incubation card. When loyalty is high, the
                        card will not need to be tamed. Until the app is developed, there will not be a
                        loyalty tracker. In its place, players will add 1 to attack and defense rolls
                        made for their declared type.

                    <h3>Defeating a Soul</h3>
                    <p>
                        In order to defeat a soul, you must first weaken them by injuring or breaking
                        their KEAL means. This is accomplished by attacking with your soul’s
                        KEAL means. Each soul has a certain KEAL means tolerance that it
                        can take before becoming vulnerable to a final attack. See KEAL means
                        count below. Modifiers are applied based on the KEAL means being used.
                        (See <a href="#keal_means">Character and Species (Soul): KEAL Means</a> for more
                        information) After an unsuccessful blow, the player loses their ability to
                        attack with that card for this diel cycle. On the defender’s next turn, they
                        must choose to attack or retreat. If an effect says souls take X damage, then
                        the damage will apply to either the KEAL means or the final blow. If it
                        applies to the final blow, the card becomes wasted and is <a href="#discarding_runout">discarded</a>
                        without
                        a final attack.

                    <h3>KEAL Means Damage, Healing, and Tolerance</h3>
                    <p>
                        As souls accrue injuries (lose KEAL means), their tolerance for new injuries
                        becomes smaller. Injuries usually occur one at a time, but some can inflict
                        multiple at once. See below for an example. Some can even defeat souls
                        without contest under the correct conditions. Injuries should be noted on the
                        KEAL Means Damage Tracker on the cards page on kipukas.cards. When any card’s
                        KEAL means count reaches the last number, they become downed. This means they can’t
                        take any more punishment and become vulnerable to being engaged in a final
                        attack. If the card either survives a final attack or is not engaged in a final
                        attack, it won’t be able to engage in attacks. As well, its movement speed is
                        halved unless it is healed. (See <a href="#moving_downed_souls">Maps (The Kipukas): Movement:
                            Moving Downed Souls</a>
                        for more information) If a soul is caught exposed during a storm they will lose one KEAL
                        means
                        or if they are downed they will be wasted.
                        <br><br>
                        Souls can be healed by other souls, terrain features, or items with a healing
                        ability. Unless otherwise stated, healing occurs during the night. The soul
                        must be within the same territory as the healing entity or within its specified
                        healing range. Healers can only heal a certain number of KEAL means with
                        in a certain number of diel cycles. Most healers have the ability to heal
                        themselves under the same conditions mentioned above, unless they are
                        downed.

                            The default will be dice based attacking. The attacking die type will be
                            determined by the attacking card. Material and Habitat bonuses may

                        <li>
                            The default will be dice based defending. The defending die type will be
                            determined by the defending card. Material and Habitat bonuses may

                    <p>
                        Once a soul’s KEAL means count is down to 0, it may be engaged in a final
                        attack. This must be won in order to waste the soul under attack. This is
                        always two D20s rolled against each other. The resulting rolls are adjusted
                        based on archetypal adaptation and motivation. (See <a href="#soul_type">Character and Species
                            (Soul) Cards: Soul Type</a> for more information) If the attack is
                        lost, then the attack comes to a close. If the attack is won, the defender is
                        wasted. (See <a href="#discarding_runout">Discarding Cards and Deck Runout</a> for more
                        information)

                    <p>
                        If an attack results in a tie (i.e., the values of the attack and defense dice rolls
                        after modifiers are applied are equal or if the mini-game does not result in a clear winner),
                        the souls will engage in a brawl. In order to complete a brawl,
                        both players need to look at their soul’s four digit brawl sequence. The brawl
                        sequence consists of letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores. In order to
                        determine the victor, players compare the characters from left to right
                        according to the table below:

                    <p>
                        If you are in a badly losing fight, retreating may be beneficial. It can allow
                        you to regroup and redeploy to a more favorable position. Players may retreat
                        from an attack after their opponent has stopped their attack, but before
                        launching a counterattack. At this point, the opposing player decides if they
                        let you go, or they challenge the escape. If the opposing player wishes to
                        prevent the escape, the escapee must win a roll of 2 D6 against a D20 for each
                        soul they wish to retreat. After these rolls, for each success, you get to decide
                        which soul to retreat. Downed souls may only retreat with the company of a
                        not downed soul.

                    <p>
                        In the above examples, we have our character, Hilbert, locked in battle with
                        a species card called the Myrthvither Raven. The
                        defending card’s (Hilbert) archetypal adaptation matches the player’s declared affinity,
                        so the card receives a bonus to all rolls made by the card. The first attack
                        launched will be a KEAL means attack. The habitat of this card is forest
                        and the battle, according to the geography, is taking place in forest. This
                        gives the defender a bonus to each KEAL attack made in this territory.
                        Unfortunately, the defender is a nomad, which neutralizes this bonus.
                        In this case, neither cards habitat's secondary effect kicks in.
                        Next, each player chooses a KEAL means and writes it on their grease
                        board. On the count of three, players reveal their choice to one another.
                        Don't worry we will get back at the opponent.

                    <h3>Scenario Walkthrough</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hilbert will use his Majestic Beak to defend against the Raven's Symbiont Barrage,
                        and the bonus would be checked against the fists tool on kipukas.cards
                        (See <a href="#adaptations">Soul Type: Archeptypal Adaptations</a> for more information.) anor
                        using the provided typing table documentation if you perfer a manual check.
                        A key thing to note is that each type has a different effect on the other type's
                        attack power, up to three per type positive or negatively. This can really influence
                        the result of the bout. In this case, the attack die modifier is an decrease of 5. If
                        the attack wins (which it has a very miserable chance of), the defender’s (Hilbert) KEAL
                        means count is reduced by one and the attacker has the opportunity to push
                        on and attack again. This continues until the attacker loses, chooses to stop
                        the attack, the defenders KEAL means count drops to 0, or the defending opponent attempts
                        a retreat for all the cards in the conflicted territory. Hilbert rolls with 2 D6 dice
                        where as the Myrthvither Raven rolls with only 1 D6. This coupled with the type
                        advantage of Hilbert's KEAL means ensures his victory in this defense. So,
                        the turn ends for the attactker.

                    <h3>Scenario Walkthrough</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Next day the shoe is on the other foot, so to say.
                        Now Hilbert is going to attack the Myrthvither Raven. Normally, this would involve the reverse
                        role of the previous scenario, but the Myrthvither Raven is special. It modifies how the
                        opponent
                        can engauge it at the expense of 0 KEAL means. This means if it losses once, it is wasted.
                        In order to face the Myrthvither Hilbert successfully roll the standard trap detection to find
                        the raven. Assuming this is successful the raven will likely be defeaded due to being weak
                        compaired
                        to the almighty King Hilbert. It is a mear scout after all. We could assume it was wasted.
                        However;
                        let's pretend that the Myrthvither Raven is now equipted with some item that gives it one
                        additional
                        K.E.A.L means to lose. This would mean that it is now downed and vulnerable to the final blow.
                        Now Hilbert engages in the final attack. Given that both cards have the Avian archetypal
                        adaptation
                        neither is at a disadvantage since adaptations of the same type usualy do not interact.
                        Additionally,
                        neither motive has an advantage against the other. However; the Myrthvither Raven is in the
                        Support Preservation triad with it's motivational type with would give it a bonus of 3 to it's
                        final defense roll. Hilberts motivational triad ability only applies in defense, so it will not
                        kick in here. If the final attack is successful (always two D20 rolled against each other) then
                        the defender
                        normally gets removed from the game (See <a href="#discarding_runout">Discarding Cards and Deck
                            Runout</a>
                        for more information). If at any point the sum of the rolls and bonuses were tied the battle
                        match would end
                        with a <a href="#brawl">brawl</a>. We will assume Hilbert won the final bout and end the
                        scenario here.

                        These cards modify territory either to benefit or hinder souls in the area.
                        Some may be placed at random across the entire board, while others may
                        offer controlled placement. These may target your opponent’s territory claims,
                        your territory claims, unclaimed territories, or any territory regardless of
                        status. Only one terrain feature can be in play on a territory at a time.
                        Territory features cannot be placed within a territory if it was taken this play.
                        Unless otherwise specified, a new terrain feature played in a territory will
                        replace the terrain feature card currently in play on the territory. Some of
                        these cards must be revealed because their effects are instant and continuous.
                        Unless stated otherwise, most terrain features are revealed at the discretion of
                        the claim owner. If a section is claimed with an unrevealed terrain feature,
                        you must reveal that feature to your opponent. These cannot be moved by a
                        soul unless otherwise stated.

                    <p>
                        Some cards apply an effect to a territory via a method of random selection. In
                        order to properly select this territory, roll a D20 (or a D12 if you own any). If
                        the number rolled is within the highest number on the board, then apply the
                        effect to that territory. Otherwise, re-roll until the roll is less than or equal to
                        the highest territory number. Alternatively, a random number generator is a
                        good fit here. There are a bunch of free ones that you can use if you prefer

                <h2>Trap Cards</h2>
                Lay these in territories to activate as entities move between and through
                territories. These require a reasonable soul to lay them unless stated
                otherwise on the card. Upon moving a soul into or within a territory with
                frenemy unrevealed cards, traps must first be rolled against to see if any are
                activated. If the trap is activated via the conditions listed in the trap card’s
                description, then apply its effects against the enemy attacker on top of the
                card stack. If the trap is not sprung, roll to determine if the trap is detected.
                If detected, remove from play; otherwise, the trap will attempt to activate as
                the enemy moves through the territory where it is placed. Most traps activate
                on a D20 roll, which is why players must always roll when entering a territory
                under with opposing unrevealed cards. Traps are detected if a 1,2,7, or 8 is
                rolled. Some very rare cards may have the ability to change these numbers, so
                be careful! Once laid, these cards can be moved by a soul unless otherwise
                stated. As always, the reasonability of this action can be challenged. They
                remain unrevealed during movement, but the opponent can now deduce that
                it is either a trap or an item card, as moving terrain features and souls via
                this method is extremely rare

                <h2>Sabotage Cards</h2>
                <p>
                    Play these cards under the cover of night and mess with your opponent’s next
                    turn. Sabotage card effects can target a wide variety of play aspects, from
                    temporarily disabling mechanical souls to blowing up terrain features.
                    Sabotage cards can only be played once a night. Their effects are usually
                    applied to the next day roll; however, cards can change this if specified.
                    Unlike most other cards in Kipukas, the effects of sabotage cards tend to be
                    fixable under specific conditions or after a certain number of turns. Also,
                    sabotage cards have a higher likelihood of success when compared to traps.
                    Unlike traps; however, sabotage cards have consequences for the player who
                    attempted to sabotage if they fail. This can be anything from jailing souls for
                    a number of turns to wasting the soul who attempted to plant the explosive.
                    As such, these cards have three aspects important to game play: Success
                    Criteria, Successful Sabotage Result, and Failure Consequence. Typically,
                    sabotage cards will state rolling a D20 against two D6 as the activation
                    criteria.

                        These cards are used in crafting. Crafting provides potions, equipment, and
                        other boosters. A single item will have far less power (or no power) than a
                        crafted item. Furthermore, the more items used in a craft, the more powerful
                        the final crafted item will be. Unless otherwise stated, items can be moved
                        unrevealed by souls. Generally, if an effect or attack with an equipped item
                        fails, you may try that effect or attack again during the next diel cycle. If a
                        crafted item emulates another card type (i.e. trap card, soul card, etc.) please
                        review the respective section on how to play the card. Items and crafted items
                        are generally not destroyed, but rather dropped when a soul equipped withthem is
                        wasted. If a territory is under contention when this happens, each
                        player chooses a suitable card to attempt to grab the item. A KEAL means
                        bout will ensue where the victor equips the item and the loser takes KEAL
                        means damage. (See <a href="#ADR">Attack, Defense, and Retreat</a> for more information)
                        If only one player has a suitable soul(s), the opponent can only defend the
                        dropped item, not equip it. If neither player has a suitable soul in the
                        territory, the dropped item is ignored until a suitable soul move into the
                        conflict or the contention is resolved.

                    <p>
                        Crafting an item takes a full play and involves using two to three item cards
                        (see <a href="#recipes">recipes</a> below). If a crafting recipe is being guessed (competitors
                        and
                        refs can tell you if you are correct) and the guess is wrong, then discard and
                        draw a new hand. Once an item is crafted, you can keep the cards together to
                        represent that item, or if you prefer, you can submit the recipe to Kipukas
                        then purchase a single card representation of the crafted item when available.
                        Crafted items may enhance cards from other categories or produce cards from
                        other categories. Once applied to a card, an enhancement can be moved or
                        removed, unless otherwise specified. Crafting creature cards is the only way to
                        have more than a single copy of a creature in your deck, but you can only
                        have one natural soul card and one crafted soul card. There will be no
                        exceptions to this rule. Once an item is crafted, it either needs to be used
                        according to the recipe’s description or hidden on a controlled territory (max
                        1 per territory). To use hidden items, you simply pull the item from the
                        territory and craft as normal. If a territory is taken which contains hidden
                        items, the items must be revealed unless protected by a different active card.
                        Control of the revealed cards, while in play, is given to the new claim holder.
                        The claim holder must then decide to use, hide the items again, or discard the
                        items.

                    <h3>Equip Items to Souls</h3>
                    <p>
                        Items are often able to equip to a soul to increase some aspect of the card’s
                        abilities. Items are equipped the night they are crafted or during the day
                        before the end of your turn. Equipped items may transfer between souls if
                        they occupy the same space (i.e., same base camp or transit stand). Equipped
                        items may be allowed to be unequipped where they stay in the territory which
                        they were unequipped for any soul to be able to pick up. The cards follow the
                        soul as a stack of cards.

                    <p>
                        Crafting recipes must be discovered and kept for reference later. In

                        recipe can be used in this fashion. Normally, you present the recipe from your
                        recipe deck to the other player to prove you can play the item combo

                <h2>Stealing Cards</h2>
                <p>
                    We don’t condone stealing another player’s card out of game; however, if you
                    would consider such a thing, I doubt you care what we think. Despite this, we
                    are more than happy to encourage stealing in game! Cards will tell you to
                    steal either from your opponent’s hand, deck or either. You might be able to
                    steal the cards revealed or unrevealed, depending on the instruction of the
                    card. Either way, you begin by declaring whether you will steal from your
                    opponent’s hand or deck. Then your opponent will fan out the cards you have
                    chosen, either facing them (unrevealed) or you (revealed). Then you pick the
                    card that you fancy and place it in your hand. If the card allows for stealing
                    revealed, you CANNOT scan the opponent’s cards to make your decision in
                    competitive play. For friendly play, handle that as you like. Most
                    IMPORTANT, you CANNOT gain more than 3 cards in your hand from
                    stealing. This is completely disbarred in Kipukas.
                    For stolen cards, it is handy to have static cling stickers to place on the card
                    sleeve as an identifier of who is in control of the card. These are not
                    recommended to be put on the card itself as they cannot be guaranteed acid
                    free. This could damage your card over repeated use, anor overtime. It should
                    go without saying that stolen cards return to their original owners at the end
                    of the game. The other options are gambling or actual thievery, in either case
                    you should consult your local laws on the legality of your behavior

                <h2>Discarding Cards and Deck Runout</h2>
                <p>
                    Once a card becomes wasted, it is discarded into a pile and cannot be played
                    again. Some card effects may target cards in either discard pile. If you run
                    out of cards before the end of the game, don’t worry, you have not lost yet.
                    You may continue using the cards you have in play on the kipuka. If both
                    players run out of cards, either may still manage to take all the remaining
                    territory even without cards in hand. Here they would win under standard
                    conditions. Otherwise, play until no characters or species (including <a href="#rouge">rouge
                        species</a>
                    ) are left on the kipuka. At this point, the players stop contention
                    under a forced peace and hold convention. Here they discuss how to proceed
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Keep the peace:</b>
                        Allow the player with
                        more territories to win. If an equal number of territories is possessed,
                        the game is a tie. (Good for a shorter game)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Call the reserves:</b>
                        Both players choose whether to reuse the deck they just fought with or change
                        to another deck. Each player writes either keep or change on their
                        whiteboard. Next they reveal, at the same time, the decision they made.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    It is worth while to note that if both parties are in total agreement to keep the peace
                    this stragety is fully acceptable at compatitions.
                    If an agreement can’t be reached within a few minutes, just rage-quit, because
                    the other person must be pretty insufferable. Why were you playing a game
                    with them in the first place?

                    <h2>Building Decks</h2>
                    <p class="!text-4xl">
                        Decks are built gradually in Kipukas. To keep barriers to entry as low as
                        possible we offer a starter kit that includes a starter map (changes by season),
                        a starter deck or two of your choice (at first only the founder’s deck is
                        available, but more archetypal adaptation specific starter decks will be
                        produced), and two sets of tokens. Growing your deck after you purchase a
                        starter kit (or if you are ambitious, before ever purchasing one) involves
                        purchasing other starter decks separately, purchasing individual cards from
                        kipukas.us, purchasing and waiting out the incubation period for incubation
                        cards, or trading with people that you trust. Kipukas cards are valuable
                        pieces of fine art, as such we take their trade and resell seriously. You can
                        request any sell or trade to be brokered through Kipukas. A brokered trade
                        will involve both parties sending their cards to Kipukas. Each card in the
                        trade will be authenticated using our 7 factor authentication process. If all
                        cards involved in the trade are presumed authentic, we will complete the trade
                        and send the cards to their new owners. If any cards are found to be
                        inauthentic the trade will be canceled, the authentic cards will be returned to
                        their owners and the inauthentic cards will be retained by Kipukas. This
                        process protects your information as neither party gets to know the other’s
                        address while protecting you from counterfeit cards. Kipukas will also put
                        cards that you want to trade, sell, or auction on our website and inform you
                        of offers as they are made. Keep watch for Kipukas Trade Deals, where we
                        offer an exceptional trade from time to time (frequency increases as customer
                        base builds). <br>
                        As for recipes, you can submit a request for the recipe card with your next
                        order. Recipes also act as information that players can trade. Standardly, one
                        recipe is given out with the purchase of three cards or three recipes with the
                        purchase of one starter pack. If a certain recipe is requested in the order
                        notes, it will replace one of the random recipes you would have received.

                    <h3>Incubation Cards</h3>
                    These cards can be purchased, traded, won or given away just as all the other
                    card types; however, these cannot be played. Instead, they represent an
                    incubation time that allows them to be traded for a soul with an increased
                    loyalty (See <a href="#affinity">Affinity</a> for more information). The longer the incubation
                    period, the rarer the card Kipukas will send to you. The prices of these cards
                    are lower than the equivalent character or species available for purchase. Also,
                    incubation cards allow access to the rarest card categories, normally reserved
                    for competition winners and special event giveaways, if you are willing to wait
                    out a long incubation period. The number of these cards is fixed for each
                    category, so when they sell out, you will have to wait until one of the
                    incubation cycles completes in order to incubate a soul of your own. For the
                    unparalleled and winners circle rarity cards, you will be allowed to request a
                    soul type. If you wish, you may also submit an artist’s rendition of the card
                    with a backstory, then request that the card be incubated. It is not a
                    guarantee that it will be produced; however, it will be heavily considered.

                    <p>
                        Maps are 3D representations of territory and control. Each map hosts stands
                        that represent traveling time and 8 to 12 territories that represent control.
                        Each territory can host a max of 3 souls, unless otherwise specified. In each
                        territory there are stands for soul tokens and stands for base camp or capital
                        tokens. Soul tokens represent the position of a revealed soul, while square
                        base camps and capitals act as points of entry for new souls, a place for
                        revealed or unrevealed souls to stay, and represent control of a territory
                        Capitals act the same as base camps, but are particularly important to game
                        play because your opponent will not be able to take your capital until they
                        take all other territories on the board. Territories also represent opportunities
                        or dangers for souls which typically dwell in or avoid the geography (See
                        <a href="#habitat">Character and Species (Soul) Cards: KEAL Means: Habitat</a> and
                        <a href="#geography">Maps (The Kipukas): Geography</a> for more information). For
                        competition purposes, only Kipukas produced boards are allowed; however, we
                        encourage you to develop your own maps for personal play. If you enjoy your
                        design, you should submit it to Kipukas. We might just produce it and pay
                        you!

                        When a card enters the map it starts at one of the player controlled base
                        camps or their capital, either unrevealed or revealed, dependent on the
                        player’s choice. Cards cannot be moved this diel cycle. As it becomes
                        strategically advantageous, each player should choose to move their souls in
                        play. This can be done by following the lower lines which connect between the
                        circular transit stands and the square base camp stands. Every territory hosts
                        a max of 3 souls, and each soul has a finite number of spaces which it can
                        traverse. When a soul moves, the card is placed on the mat slot with the
                        same number as the territory moved into. In order to move, you must reveal
                        the soul unless the card says otherwise. If a territory only contains transit
                        slots, this is a transit territory. This occurs due to the difficulties required
                        building within the territory, figuratively speaking. A good example is a
                        territory filled with water (See <a href="#geography">Maps (The Kipukas): Geography</a> for
                        more information about water movement). These locations are clearly labeled
                        on the mat as ’transit territory’, so cards moved within should be placed
                        accordingly. If an enemy is in the same territory that you moved to, you must
                        engage an attack. Also, you cannot move past an enemy waiting on a
                        movement slot. See <a href="#ADR">Attack, Defense, and Retreat</a> for more information;
                        otherwise, read <a href="#claiming_territories">claiming territories</a> below if you just moved
                        into a base camp
                        slot. If a revealed soul is in a base camp, then no soul token is used. If the
                        soul is currently on a movement stand, a soul token is used to represent this.
                        If more than one soul is on the same movement stand, stack the individual
                        tokens to represent the group. If you have two souls in the same territory on
                        different movement stands, flip a soul token over and declare which soul is
                        represented by that token. If your soul moves back into a base camp, then
                        keep the card revealed, move its card to the rear of the territory’s cards stack,
                        and remove its soul token from the board.

                    <p>
                        In order to win the game, you must first claim territories. To claim territories,
                        you must move at least one soul into the base camp of the territory you wish
                        to claim. If it is empty, congrats, you have a new base camp! Place a base
                        camp token on the square stand, then continue your turn. Otherwise, if the
                        territory has a claim on it, you must oust your opponent by defeating their
                        traps, terrain features, and souls before you can replace their claim with your
                        own. See Contention below. There is no limit to the number of territories that
                        can be claimed in a single day. If you think you can take all territories,
                        including the opposing player’s capital, in a single day, go for the win!

                    <h3>Contention</h3>
                    <p class="!text-4xl">
                        If a frenemy’s soul enters territory controlled by opposition, the territory
                        comes into contention. Under contention, players must perform the card
                        activation sequence (See <a href="#card_activation">Card Activation</a> for more
                        information). Cards act when you enter an enemy’s territory. You will
                        need to contend with their traps and terrain features before attacking revealed
                        souls. In order to claim the territory, you must take the base camp by moving
                        a soul onto the base camp stand. If your opponent has any revealed souls in
                        the territory you moved into, you must attack and defeat all enemies or
                        become defeated yourself to relieve the contention. If your opponent has
                        multiple enemies in a territory, you can attack one or all (one at a time) of
                        the enemies in the space, but you must defeat all enemies to progress out of
                        the space in the same diel cycle. If you decide to stop your attack before all
                        enemy entities are defeated, your opponent will either choose to attack on
                        their next turn or retreat and move out of the territory. If they stop their
                        counterattack before all your souls are defeated, on the following day, you
                        have the option to continue the fight or retreat and move out of the space.
                        (See <a href="#retreat">Attack, Defense, and Retreat: Retreat</a> for more information) After
                        the revealed souls are defeated, you can force your opponent to reveal any
                        unrevealed souls. The opponent then has the choice to stay in defense of the
                        territory or retreat out of the territory with the previously unrevealed souls.
                        If you are not successful in taking the territory, your opponent is not
                        obligated to reveal entities, traps, or terrain features unused in their defense.
                        Once your opponent has exhausted all of their defense options, and you move
                        a soul into the base camp, you should replace their base camp token with
                        your base camp token. At this point all terrain features and items must be
                        revealed then control of the cards, while they are in play, is transferred to the
                        victor. If a set trap exists in the newly controlled territory, it stays unrevealed
                        and it still works for the player that set it. Each time the player souls into or
                        within the territory it will attempt to activate against them. (See <a href="#traps">Trap

                    <h3>Geography</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each territory has a geography that corresponds to the map’s topography.
                        This geography interacts with the habitat of the soul cards in the territory.
                        (See <a href="#habitat">Character and Species (Soul) Cards: KEAL Means: Habitat</a>
                        for more information)

                    <p>
                        In addition to the boat(s) marking the water habitats, Kipukas maps use
                        docks to represent the points that souls can enter the water from. If a
                        movement path leads to water, but no dock is present, you may not enter the
                        water at that location with a boat. However, if you entered from a different
                        location with a dock, you may land at that point. Cards may attempt to
                        swim by rolling 2 D6. If you roll 2 + 2 the card has successfully swum.
                        Attempting to swim does not cost movement, but can only be attempted once
                        per soul per day

                <h2>Game Mats</h2>
                <p>
                    Mats connect a soul card’s position with the soul token’s position on the map.
                    This makes game play more comfortable by organizing the game space.
                    Kipukas will have a set of mats, but will encourage community development
                    and artist support with regard to producing more engaging and creative mats.
                    Make them as personal as you wish. The only production guideline, as of now,
                    is the number of section slots must be equal to the number of territories.
                    These must include reference numbers. Additionally, transit territory space
                    must be allocated on the mat. The standard mat size that Kipukas produces
                    is 17×24in. As always, you can submit your creations to us, and you might
                    just have something we want to produce and get paid!

                        reasonability level. My personal favorite example is a dragon wielding a stick
                        to boost its attack. That is all sorts of wrong. If your opponent attempts to
                        make a move that just simply makes no sense, you have the right to contest
                        it. You should do it in this way.

                        Yes, it is definitely a lot to learn at first. Kipukas is a game that rewards
                        repeated play with ease. The more you can play the game, the better you will
                        know the card mechanics, the turn structure, and the interactions between the
                        pieces. The overall plan is to create tools (i.e. phone/web application) to aid
                        players in keeping track of the game components. This is, of course, if there is
                        enough interest in the game as a whole. Either way, we try our best to make
                        this rules set as comprehensive and digestible as possible. When possible, we
                        will post videos to clarify game play aspects and intent of the mechanics. In
                        all, don’t worry about capturing every aspect of this game. As I stated, there
                        is a lot going on. Have fun with it, make house rules, and we are always open
                        to suggestions. These rules are geared for a future with competitions where
                        everything will be scrutinized. At this point, don’t get bogged down. You can
                        do it!

                            their deck. Once drawn, the player must play the card unrevealed. The

                            is the player that managed to defeat the most soul cards. A number of
                            soul cards and total card limit should be agreed upon except at

                            agreed number of those types in their decks. The huntable cards must
                            be played and cannot be discarded. Additionally, an overall deck size
