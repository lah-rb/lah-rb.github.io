I"#<p>The passage through the maples is a ceremony held once every three years to sympolize the renewal of the life cycle of the bees. The culture responsible for holding the ceremony holds a traditional economy through their LACA division which is primarily focused on the production of honey. Passing under the arch is a regular occurance for the souls in this area as they do so while taking stock to a larger port down river. The arch was built up many years ago and is considered a reminder that they live among the home of their ancestors.</p>
