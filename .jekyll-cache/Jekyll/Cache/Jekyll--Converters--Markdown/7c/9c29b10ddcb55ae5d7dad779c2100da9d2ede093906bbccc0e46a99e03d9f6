I"è<p>The artificer of the salt chancel is no longer a person, through they remember when a past when it was so. They begin their end by sailing as explorers, tradesmen, or pilgrims. All who travel by sea may become the artificer if they find the misfortune to cross the chancel‚Äôs path. No individual knows the role of the chancel, except for the artificer. Once the chancel meets people upon the seas, all who are unworthy of its purpose are torn from life to bind the soul to it. The unfortunate one who can serve its purpose better than the current artificer who becomes removed, imbued, and leaves disposed to never reveal the chancel‚Äôs mission.</p>
