I"4<p>Born from the burning forests, these spirits inhabit and breathe new life into the remains of the residing flora. Their one sense of purpose and reason for bearing life is to bring peace to the souls inhabiting anor visiting their home. Often conflicts arise, sometimes with outside influences, which disturb the delicate peace shared by the forest creatures. Should the disturbance go so far as to arise the interest of the Spirit of the Pyrostegia Dragon, the forgoers need not worry about the rustling of leaves, for the dead fear nothing in the forest.</p>
