I"”<p>The artificer of the the salt chancel is no longer a person, through they remember when a past when it was so. They begin their end by sailing. Some are explorers, others tradesmen, yet some are pilgrams. All who travel by sea may become the artificer as the salt chancel moves. No individual knows the role of the chancel except for the artificer. Once the chancel meets people upon the seas, all who are unworthy of its purpose are torn to bind to into it. The unfortunate one is the one who can serve its purpose better than the current artificer who becomes removed, imbued, and leaves the previous disposed to never reveal the chancelâ€™s mission.</p>
