I"~<p>The allele sect consists of beings that came to rights through natural birth, but desired change from the body they were given. Some sought changes for power or appearance, but the members that they deem explorers seek modifications to escape themselves. Often these changes are viewed as malformations or mutilations, but to the explorers they are necessary to keep their way. Partial or full blindness is a common method used to heighten their other senses. Other less common, but more drastic procedures include removal of limbs, appendages, tongue, and to increase or decrease the sensitivity of pain receptors for a short list. Many of the new explorers die due to poor execution of the procedures, an inability to protect themselves, or by their own hand. The ones who grow old; however, become revered within the allele sect. Often times they are considered to be sages who are able to transcend themselves and bend the laws of possibility. Despite their self-inflicted limitations, the creed that the explorers take challenges them to survive and learn from in continually harsher environments. It is considered an honor among nature.</p>
