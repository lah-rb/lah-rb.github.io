I"<p>The race of bucket sized mantis men was born in an attempt to clear a kipukas of enemy forces consisting of airborn insectisoidals. Much to the disappointment of their creators, this species only fights to feed. Once abondanded by the war mongers, they grew diverse with only the stillest youngs groomed to become illusionists. The best of this creed easily trick enemies into believing they found others of their own kind thereby luring them closer. Once near, they manipulate the trees around them to ensnare their pray.</p>
