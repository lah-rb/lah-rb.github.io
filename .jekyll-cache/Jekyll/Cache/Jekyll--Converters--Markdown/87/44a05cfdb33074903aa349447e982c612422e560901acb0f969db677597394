I"<p>The race of bucket sized mantis men was born in an attempt to clear a kipuka of enemy forces consisting of airborne insectisoidals. Much to the disappointment of their creators, this species only fights to feed. Once abandoned by the warmongers, they grew diverse, with only the stillest young groomed to become illusionists. The best of this creed easily trick enemies into believing they found others of their own kind, thereby luring them closer. Once near, they manipulate the surrounding trees to ensnare their prey.</p>
