I"G<p>After traveling the sand ruins created by weapons of mass destruction, researchers theorized that one would surly die if they attempted to cross by foot alone. They then developed a huminoid form as close to death as possible. It requires almost no water nor food and endures heat increadibly well. While it looks like a man, this species is not intellegent nor is it sentiant. It was designed to take simple commands well. They are used as a scare tactic in war and a less than reliable scout. Despite their looks, they are easy to care for and make great pets for children.</p>
