I"<p>Piffions were the product of a comical experiment paying amage to the works of an ancient geneologist known as Charles Darwin. Where Darwin bred fansy pigeons, the creatorâ€™s of these beauties wanted to prove the feasibility of the griffin form. Unfortunatly, the experiment did not work as planned and an batch of an early copy incapable of flight escaped into the city. Piffions are now as common there as pigeons are in most cities. Throwing seed is enough to summon a horde and create a good distraction.</p>
