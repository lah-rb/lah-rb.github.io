I"<<p>Liliel is a product of a cloning experiment of the human sized fairy Mihela. Both where intended to prove the feasibility of extending the human form. By adding wings, these so named fairies are capable of short distance flight which aids them in transversing difficult terrains. Unlike Mihela, Liliel considers Mihela a sister despite neither having a natural mother. Liliel studied to become a doctor after her release from the program. The political circumstance coarsed her into bringing her talents to the front lines of the war for the first kipuka. There she worked as a field medic attempting to keep natural born and created alive through brutal fighting. She carries a blunt edged sword intended to push her foes far enough away to escape via flight. She tries to kill only when threatened with eminuate death.</p>
