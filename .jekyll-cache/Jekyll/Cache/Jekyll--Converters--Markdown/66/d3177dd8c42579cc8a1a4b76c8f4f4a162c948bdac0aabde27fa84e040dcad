I"<p>Piffions were the product of a comical experiment, paying homage to the works of an ancient genealogist known as Charles Darwin. Where Darwin bred fancy pigeons, the creatorâ€™s of these beauties wanted to prove the feasibility of the griffin form. Unfortunately, the experiment did not work as planned, and an early batch incapable of flight escaped into the city. Piffions are now as common there as pigeons are in most cities. Throwing fragrent seed is enough to summon a horde and create a good distraction.</p>
