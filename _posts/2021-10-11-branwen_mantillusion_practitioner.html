description: "The race of bucket sized mantis men was born in an attempt to clear a kipukas of enemy forces
consisting of airborn insectisoidals. Much to the disappointment of their creators,
this species only fights to feed. Once abondanded by the war mongers, they grew
diverse with only the stillest youngs groomed to become illusionists. The best
of this creed easily trick enemies into believing they found others of their own
kind thereby luring them closer. Once near, they manipulate the trees around them
to ensnare their pray."
