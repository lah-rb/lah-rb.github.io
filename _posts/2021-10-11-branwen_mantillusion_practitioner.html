description: "The race of bucket sized mantis men was born in an attempt to clear a kipuka of enemy forces
consisting of airborne insectisoidals. Much to the disappointment of their creators,
this species only fights to feed. Once abandoned by the warmongers, they grew
diverse, with only the stillest young groomed to become illusionists. The best
of this creed easily trick enemies into believing they found others of their own
kind, thereby luring them closer. Once near, they manipulate the surrounding trees
to ensnare their prey."

play_style: "Other cards must attack Branwen first then Branwen attacks and the
attacker becomes the defender for the first attack between the cards."
