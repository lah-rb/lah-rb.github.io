description: "
The solom court is held. The perpetrator knows of the wrong they are accused of and knows
the conviction of there heart. This is not a court of people, this is a court of a king.
The subject feels the weight and power of the king rock from side, to side as they decern
with perfect judgement the fate of the accused. 'I hold the high seat, tasked to protect these lands.
I feel the spirit of all those who tred upon me. Your guilt is not a question, but your omision stands as such.
So tell me, what crimes agaist this kingdom will you admit to?'
