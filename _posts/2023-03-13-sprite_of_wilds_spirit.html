description: "Many times good intentions go awry. These creatures measuring about
2 ft or 60 cm from toe to wing top were created as sentient pollinators for cultivating
the berries from the regina bacarum plant. These bear berries, which have become
highly prized for their sweet flavor and acclaimed aphrodisiac properties. This
demand along with agricultural difficulties called for the development of the highly
mobile caretaker fairy species. Small and light enough to flutter plant to plant
in an expansive garden, but strong enough to defend from would be poachers. However,
as demand continued to grow, the fairies suffered ever greater threats to their lives
and livelihood. To defend their home, they began taming beasts of burden, to fight
in their stead and under their command. This curbed the dangers for a time as most
physical beings would sustain great wounds from the gnash, tusk, or claw bore upon them.
Then the possessions started to occur. Fairy stole from fairy, killing the sisters
and brothers that stood against them. The highest of their tribal leadership elected
for great countermeasures. By altering the genetic makeup of their most promising
young defenders, they created warriors of gold sensitive to and capable of excising
the violent possessors. While mighty, these warriors proved to be cruel wanderers.
So much as a noticed glance, may recon you for a fight."
play_style: "Has two forms: with bear and without bear. When played, it starts out
with bear. At any time it can change to without bear. To change back to with bear it
must be rolled for in accordance to the geography:<br>
<br>
Forest: roll 1, 2, or 3 with D6<br>
Mountain or Plains: roll 1 or 2 with D6<br>
Add the number 4 to the list of successful rolls if a stream, river, or creek touches
the territory.<br>
<br>
Bears are not rolled for in other geographies, therefore the form cannot change to
with bear in other geographies. If the card changes form or attempts to change
form, it cannot use regular movement this turn.<br><br>
With bear: Roll D20, one movement per turn<br>
Without bear: Roll two D6, two movement per turn<br>"
