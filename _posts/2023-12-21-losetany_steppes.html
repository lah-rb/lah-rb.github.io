description: "
This kipuka contains many expansive grasslands and wastelands. For the people living
here, it is considered a right of passage to survive a journey carrying their village
token to the wizened elder. To complete their task they must face a walk through endless
miles of grasslands, followed by a guided crossing beyond the regions tallest peak, and
finished with a 3 day trek trough the wastes. After setting out with unsure glee,
one of the tribe's young girls, Doran, just completed the first leg of her journey after
finding the guide's camp near calumniator ruinas. Almost as a sign of her inevitable success,
a bloom of the Cumulon jellyfish fills the night sky. Their waving lappets give Doran the sense that
the creatures want to greet her into the the next chapters of her life.
As she looks upon the glowing wisps of vapor, calm and reassurance wash over Doran.
Now she can prepare for the next difficult steps of her journey.
