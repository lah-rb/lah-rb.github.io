description: "Oshliath and osileth come from a brood of dragons designed genetically
to emulate the European dragons from ancient mythology. Oshliath and her mate
were one of four pairs created to test the feasibility of the European dragon's
body type and survival instinct. While intelligent, none were intended to be
sentient. Oshliath was released into the wild, where her behaviors were closely
observed. She tends to act reclusive, so it came as a shock to her research team
when they found the young dragon pup, deemed osileth, hunting alongside oshliath.
The team believes that the osileth will remain by his mother until his soft
under belly toughens with maturity."
