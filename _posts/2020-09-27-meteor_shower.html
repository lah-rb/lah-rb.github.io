play_style: "This trap does not need to be laid before use. One random territory
is laid waste: <br>
<br>
All cards in that territory are discarded. <br>
Any base camps or capitals are removed from the territory. <br>
Its geography becomes a wasteland. <br>
<br>
If the territory is empty, then this card does nothing. See Random Territory Selection
in the rule book."
