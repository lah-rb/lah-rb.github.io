play_style: "The heavy atmosphere applies a crushing effect to all souls
that enter the territory space. Cost 1 injury per turn. Owner is able to
hide objects that can never be found by the opposing player."
description: "Few explores can tolerate the kipuka built as a heavy barametric
pressure test bed. Most who go to see the progress of the wilds to not return.
This is especially true for the equatorial band where the sun blazes long, and
plants refuse to grow."
