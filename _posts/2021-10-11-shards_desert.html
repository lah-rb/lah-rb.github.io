play_style: "The heavy atmosphere applies a crushing effect to all souls
that enter the territory space. Cost: 1 keal means damage per turn, awarded a the
start of the turn. Territory holder is able to hide objects that can never be found
by the opposing player as long as this card is still in play. Souls can retrieve
the hidden objects by being in the same territory as this card. Should this card
be removed from the space, those objects become normally hidden."
description: "Few explores can tolerate the kipuka built as a heavy barometric
pressure test bed. Most who go to see the progress of the wilds do not return.
This is especially true for the equatorial band, where the sun blazes long, and
plants refuse to grow."
