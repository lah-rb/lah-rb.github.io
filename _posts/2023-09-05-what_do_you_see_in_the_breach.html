abstract piece. I don't want my interpertation to color your experiance as this seems
to be the opposite of what the artist intended."

criteria: "Play the card at night. The virus infects your opponent's capital.
You now have 2 days where you can take it before capturing the rest of your opponent's
territories."

success: "You take your opponent's capital within the 3 days time period. This does not end the game.
You now have another capital and your opponent does not. They must take all other
territories before attacking either capital."

failure: "You fail to take the capital within 3 days. Any souls still in the capital after the
time period become imprisoned. After 10 diel cycles, your opponent chooses up to 2
souls to take under their control, they release 1 of the remaining souls to you,
then your opponent wastes the rest."

Work for hire! Employ this digital fiend to wreck havoc upon you enemies defenses!
Act today before he goes on a mission for some one else, most notably your opponent!
But wait, just in, he says he will through in healthy dose of chaos to go with that
havoc! You just can't wait! Order now!
