description: "
Most people shrink from the idea of living in an area where all soil is
foreign ground. A place where the annual high temperature rarely exceeds that
of frozen water by more than a few degrees. Yet, some individuals, driven by
desperation or a unique vision, seek to this place to create paradise.
Over many years of settlement, new arts have sprouted amidst the barren backdrop,
much like seedlings nourished by the struggles of their people. Some
of these arts shape the culture, bringing joy amidst the bitter surroundings.
Others shape daily life and struggle, aiming to make tomorrow a bit easier.
The culmination of these artistic and technological advancements is found at the
capital city's Arctechnic Institute, dedicated to advancing this free people's paradise. <br>
<br>
In one of the Arctechnic Institute's study tracks, it is customary for students
and professors to periodically demonstrate their mastery of life on the frozen terrain.
This practice is of great interest to those who wish to test new equipment designs,
validate environmental theories, or gain a deeper understanding of their harsh surroundings.
Like many adventurers, they return with stories of love and loss, of great heroics
or immense tragedy. Some pack out or even adorn artifacts from their excursions as
proof of their tales, exaggerated or not. Among the favored study sites
are the open-pit volcanoes that dot the interior of the wasteland. These rare
warm spots attract astonishing numbers of flora and fauna, drawing both researchers and traders. <br>
<br>
The most captivating creatures drawn to these volcanic oases are the
seals of light (loosely translated from the local dialect). These
translucent beings shimmer with an ethereal glow, their bodies
pulsating with light which mirrors the lava pools below.
They are entirely dependent on external sources of heat and light
for survival, thriving in the unique microclimates around the
volcanoes. <br>
<br>
The seals of light have become an integral part of life in this
frozen landscape. Their presence is not just a testament to nature's
resilience, but also a symbol of hope and adaptability for the
settlers. In harsh environs, where every resource must be
carefully managed, these creatures offer a sustainable solution. <br>
<br>
During expeditions, Arctechnic wonderers often carry special lanterns
which cast an especially enticing volcanic glow. The seals of light 
find this most alluring, so they tend to gather near. At night,
around campfires, the translucent bodies of the seals create a
mesmerizing display of soft, dancing shadows on the snow anor ice. <br>
<br>
In modern times, traveling with seals of light has become commonplace.
These translucent beings are not only a source of sustenance but also
a symbol of the deep connection between the people and the area they
have chosen to call home. As travelers journey through the frozen
wasteland, the seals of light serve as guides, leading them to the warm
oases that sustain natural life in this harsh environment.
