description: "Svetlana is the heiress to a great and ancient fortune from a family
who possesses great pride. As such, she was highly encouraged to pursue rigorous formal
education in the sciences in order to offer great impact on the world and further
her families name. She spent more than twice the average amount of time dedicated
to her studies and emerged a prominent biophysicist whose work promoted the capabilities
of cryogenics. Still, she often dreams of the life she desired when she was little.
The life of free expression, the life of an artist. Svetlana, in her little free time,
carves ice sculptures representative of her most recent research as catharsis to
her present and past."
