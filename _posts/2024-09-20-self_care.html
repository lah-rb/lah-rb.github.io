description: "
Somedays you just need a break, ya know? Like those days when the squirles just won't stop
chattering, or when the wolves keep needlessly scent marking your fav trees. They are like your
BFFs and are alway like, ewe... I HATE it when they do that too me. I mean, you try
to lead them away with your compulsory powers, but unlike people, wolves ALWAYS find their way home.
Maybe your days don't look quite like mine, but I know, you know, that overly lively ,
just, ah! So the next time you get tired of your wolves, just sigh... become human and have a cup
of tea with me, your lovely next door forest.

play_style: "
Can heal 1 keal means damage from all souls with in the same forest movement space (not base camp or capital)
during a day diel cycle roll. All healed souls must rest (take no actions) until the next day is rolled. If 
the souls have already taken actions this day they are not eligible to recieve this effect. Self Care cannot
take other actions the day this effect is used. Self Care can engauge in keal means bouts, but if she wins 
in lue of damage, she transports the soul to a different forest movment space on the board (player's choice).
She can only be engauged in final bouts.
