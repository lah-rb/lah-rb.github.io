title: "Avian Keeper's Den"
play_style: "Acts as a prison for avian creatures. In order to imprision a soul
they must have only 1 injury before defeat and be in a territory touching the
territory this feature is within. The card will be kept in prison until the territory
is captured by the opposing player."
description: "Comming to the end of the gate, a restless explorer peers out to
discover a grand building built on what appears to be a massive floating rock. Upon
further inspection they notice a stream of flying creatures approach the ledge at
the command of the inhabitants of the palace. The explorer watches the keepers
bring their beasts in and travel out on their backs for hours. They wonder just who
built this and what greater purpose it serves."
