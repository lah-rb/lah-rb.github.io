that girl running against the wind can keep them!

criteria: "
A telekinitic maniuplator goes head to head with the souls in a base
camp vying for lucid control over their dreams. It must be one space
outside the base camp. This card may be used or continue to be used
if the soul is downed, though it may become wasted. It can try to manipulate as many souls in the
camp as desired. For each roll a keal mean bout.
"

Move each soul that loses 1 space away from the base camp. The next day
they are dazed and can't move from the space.
"

The soul regains control of their dream, and harms the telekinetic in
the process. The take either one keal means damage or a final blow and are
wasted.

description: "
Wondering on a lost trail along the recesses of her mind, a girl ponders her existance.
Does walk among a dream of her own, or is she a mear figment. The play thing of some
distant being watching her every move play out on his grand stage. Giving her subtle
nudges. A left here, a right their, walk slowly around the bend. She feels like she
has little control over any path she might take. Slipping into cognitave fuzz, each
passing step feels a little less. A right here, a left there, lean forward against
the resistance of the hill. Soon she frees in a total trance, completely uninhibited
by healthy congative function.
<br><br>
It proves to blissful to last. With her last heavy blink, her senses shock to life.
A despirate, yet sweet cry wallows in the grass along her path. A small creature,
familure, but oh, wildly different. A second head he had. One carefree and brash,
to bring antics to her life. The other sweet and subdued, to prevent her from becoming
too crude. The one with wild mane says 'Take the path forward, untold riches lie ahead'.
The other, whose ears settle low, says'Take the path back, only safety is known from where you return.'
<br><br>
Unknowning what to do the girl ponders for what feels like hours. Should I listen to you, oh free spirit,
who promises a life of abondon and untold comfort. Or should I listen to you, oh cautious one,
so faithful and true, offering contentment in what I already know. Like two tormenting children, their 
voice ring in her head, paralyzing her will to move ahead. The topic of choice circles, over and over,
until she can hear of it no more. 'You only look forward, to your next thrill or your erragant desires.
And you only look back, to your bitter knowledge and selfish fears. For now I am running back, but only
to a new road!' She runs and runs, fighting the storms of her life. Will they catch her? No, but the monsters
just might!
