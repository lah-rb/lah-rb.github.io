A bald over the top buff man with abs on his head encircled by chains weighing thousands of pounds (or kilograms. You know, they are EXTREMELY HEAVY).
He stands ferociously atop a bone pile, are they his victims or is he about to become one of them?

description: "
Some men train their bodies for the most excruitiating of physical tasks by choice, mostly to prove their exemplary masculinity.
Other men have their bodies trained for them, so that they are not just a slave to their masters, but also a slave to their own body.
In times past slaves were kept weak for fear of strong slaves leading a rebellion. However, due to a great equalization in power
thanks to ranged weapons, great physicalliy adds little to one's personal power. Brox is one such person possessing brutal strength
not by his own choice. He is no greater than a dog fighting for his master's gain and whimsy, and only feigns to the crowd a better position.
However, the spirit in Brox has not diminished. He knows it is the only aspect of his life that is freely his own, and he continues on
in hopes to one day serve a future brighter than his own.
