variation: "Trap"
title: "To Catch a Spirit"
play_style: "Trap activates on 2, 5, 16, 17, 19. Once activated turns a soul into a trap
card now called the bottle card. It becomes unable to use until activated. The bottle card attempts to
activate when a soul on their team steps into the same territory. The soul trap
activates when the player decides to exchange the soul who entered the territory to
free bottle card soul. Once exchanged, the card must be played by the
conditions listed on the card this turn. If you attempt and fail to play the bottle
card, the exchange fails, wasting the other card. If you successfully exchange,
the original bottle card is restored, then the other card becomes the new bottle card.
Once played, this card is kept in play until the bottle becomes empty by some circumstance.
Either player can attempt to exchange for the trapped soul. "
