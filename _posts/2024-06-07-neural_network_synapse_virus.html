description: "
One of a class of virus designed to infect and interrupt the neural network. Subtle in design and task, the synapse virus 
is designed to inject itself from an infected host network into a model in training. By applying slight changes to the 
matrix, the virus undercuts the sensical responses an AI provides in response to environmental input. This virus has no 
meaning of existence. 
"

play_style: "
Cannot take base camps or capitals. Only comes into contention when a Mechanical or Algorithmic soul is present. 
If it enters a keal means bout and rolls 3 less than or more than its opponents roll, its opponent becomes infected. 
Equip the synapse virus to the opponent. For every roll they make subtract the roll of a D6. Once the opponent is wasted, 
so is this card.
