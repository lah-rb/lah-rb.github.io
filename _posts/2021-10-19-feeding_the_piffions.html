description: "Piffions were the product of a comical experiment paying amage to
the works of an ancient geneologist known as Charles Darwin. Where Darwin bred
fansy pigeons, the creator's of these beauties wanted to prove the feasibility of
the griffin form. Unfortunatly, the experiment did not work as planned and an batch of an early
copy incapable of flight escaped into the city. Piffions are now as common there as pigeons
are in most cities. Throwing seed is enough to summon a horde and create a good distraction."
