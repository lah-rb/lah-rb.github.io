description: "Piffions were the product of a comical experiment, paying homage to
the works of an ancient genealogist known as Charles Darwin. Where Darwin bred
fancy pigeons, the creator's of these beauties wanted to prove the feasibility of
the griffin form. Unfortunately, the experiment did not work as planned, and an early
batch incapable of flight escaped into the city. Piffions are now as common there as pigeons
are in most cities. Throwing fragrant seed is enough to summon a horde and create a good distraction."
