description: "
The Myrthvither Raven is a constantly moving and easily adapts to new environments. 
It possesses a wicked intelligence and tends to be quite self serving.  Often, these
ravens know several languages and can effectively communicate between species. Imbued 
with foliage near death, they easily disguise themselves in natural environments. 
They act as nearly perfect scouts, if offered a strong enough incentive to put themselves at risk.
Many request exotic ant species as payment. Their intent with this behavior is unclear, however, 
some have observed ants living within their plant mass, a likely sign of a symbiotic relationship. 
"

play_style: "
Opponent must roll Std. detection (D20: 1, 2, 3, 4) before engaging in a keal means bout. 
Constantly downed. Able to move and attack normally when downed. If Myrthvither Raven 
looses a keal means bout, waste the Nythvither Raven. Reveals cards in a territory as it moves into the 
territory. These cards can be reset to unrevealed once they are not in the same territory 
as Myrthvither Raven.
