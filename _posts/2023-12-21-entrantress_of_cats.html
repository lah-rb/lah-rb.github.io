description: "
Many have heard the rumors. Some have seen the fearsome creatures, but few have survived
when met ankle to face with the black cat. Still fewer are those born to charm, entertain,
and serve the spirits within. Among these leagues are those so in tune with the beasts
that they win the beasts acclaim, no that's too strong, tolerance. These enchantresses even force the
creatures to mind, sorry no, occasionally sway their opinion of what needs to be done.
If you have experience with these creatures, you know the terror the enchantresses must
inflict to get that type of response. Meow... ahhh!
