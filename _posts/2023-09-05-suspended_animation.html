description: "
Not to mearly freeze a solid in place or capture it for a moment in time, but to
trick matter into believing it can be both. The simultaneity captured in the phase transformation
perpetuated for more than a fleeting instance. The escence of peace, an anti-entropy,
where the system no longer feels imperfect in its own energy state. Is such possibility
where we live or could it be a choice. To accept the wholeness of ourselves and be
as we are now. Where our rigor says no, our spirit pleads yes.
