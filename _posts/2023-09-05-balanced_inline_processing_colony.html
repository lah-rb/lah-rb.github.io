description: "
Biochemists, tasked by a group of descendants in Indochina, designed
a bacterium capable of transmitting electric signals around the cell wall to their colony
through the cell's pilus (hair-like appendages). These were then coxed into bacterial arrays
capable of enduring higher currents. All of this was with the intent of producing full-fledged
micro-processors capable of storing data without the use of any metal in order to smuggle secrets
into communist China. The first iteration of the project, though prohibitively expensive, proved successful
without the governments determining foul play. The agents responsible for delivering the devices
proved to be the weak point of the process. Many got caught, due to repeat travel, while others
were incapable maintaining the conditions sufficient for the chip's survival. Due to the touchy nature
of the chip's survival, data was never captured and the project lived on. Some wonder if these colonies
are capable of self awareness.

play_style: "
Requires being equipped to a carrier card to move. Any territory Balanced Inline Processing
Colony is in adds 1 and 2 to the successful sabotage die roll for sabotage targeting that territory.
If this card is removed by force from its carrier it becomes wasted. It can only survive without a carrier
in your capital where it can use the security systems and cryotec to defend and preserve itself. Its keal means
tolerance becomes 1 and it gains Security Hacking keal means in the capital.
