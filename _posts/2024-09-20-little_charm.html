description: "
Many find fascination in dreaming of and studying monsters of the deep. However,
not all monsters are born of flesh and bone. Tremondous spirits lurk amongst the
depths, seeking to feast on the souls lost to the dreadful ocean tides. At first, they
extend an offer of guiding hope to voyagers removed from body. An brilliant
light from a little charm, visible only to the departed, percing the abyss. It entrances the souls with a
promise of an end to their suffering journey, one which, in many cases, has lasted traversed for years. <br>
<br>
No previously living sapient is entirely immume to undertaking the journey or the promise
of its end. When near the light, the unwilling soul experiences a great swell from behind.
Possessed by abandoning fear, they grasp towards their false savior, still believeing in the object of their damnation.
The swell proves too powerful to fight, and no soul, living or dead, can save them from their choices. <br>
<br>
In the end, there is Little Charm, their guide to eternal nothingness.
