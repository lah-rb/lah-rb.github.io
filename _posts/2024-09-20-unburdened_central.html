description: "
Aurora 'Rory' Gale stood anchored to her workstation,
a cyber welding rig of immense infrastructural expanse
across the entire acres wide station,
as she gazed up at the labyrinthine tangle of NeuroScape's
physical infrastructure. Another grueling shift was winding
down, but the endless stream of diagnostic alerts refused
to cease. As a Tier3 Operator for omniHolo Innovations,
Rory's role was to manually splice, repair, and reboot the
antiquated yet crucial hardware supporting the company's
proprietary SpineNet, the backbone of the post modern internet.
The air reeked of burnt circuitry and desperation.
omniHolo's bean counting reluctance to upgrade the physical
systems had turned her job into a never ending game of
whack-a-bug.
<br><br>
Rory's arms, clad in a tight fitting, reinforced, feed-forward
smart-assist enabled holoSuite, the latest ominHolo attempt
to eke out just a few more tenths of labor efficiency,
moved with precision. Rory's every move now felt guided by
the whims of the holographic overlays dancing across her field of vision. She had lost count of
the number of times she'd patched up the same frail junctures,
only for them to fail again under the crushing load of global
data traffic. After all, every move you make online costs someone
Watts. SpineNet's virtual architecture was a
marvel, but its physical foundation was a creaky, hack job relic.
omniHolo's executives preached about 'prolonged system lifespan'
and 'optimized maintenance costs,' while Rory bore the brunt
of their frugality. Each spark that flew from her welding torch
seemed to ignite a fresh ember of frustration within her.
<br><br>
A particularly vicious alert shrieked through the comms system,
signaling yet another catastrophic failure in the 4D.
Rory's response was immediate, but her movements felt mechanical,
fueled by simmering resentment rather than focus. As she worked
to bypass the faulty module, a thought crystallized: How many
more times? The question detonated something within her. With
a fierce cry, Rory hurled her welding torch aside, its glowing
tip skittering across the floor. She then began to yank out
bundles of wires and cables. Don't dare think she did not know
what she was doing, oh no. With every pull, she surgically extracted
the crucial l-amps while avoiding the life taking h-amps. Madness crept
further across her face, broad in both smile and contempt. The system's
alarms screamed for once causing her pleasure, not pain.

play_style: "
Unburdened Central can move into your opponent's capital. She cannot take the capital, unless
all other territories are already claimed. Once in the capital,
she cannot move in or out of the capital, and cannot be engaged
in battle. All cards played in the capital must now be played
revealed. At any time you may choose to waste unburdened
central to waste an opponent's Glitch, Mechanical, Algorithmic,
or Energetic souls played in the capital.
