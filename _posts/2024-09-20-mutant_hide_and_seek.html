description: "
In Diurnoct's forest, where moonbeams play, <br>
A mystical realm teems with fungal sway,<br>
Insects dance, and ruins whisper tales of old,<br>
Amidst this wonder, a nuisance growing bold. <br><br>

Meet the beast of mishmash might,<br>
Lion's mane, horse's body, crow's feet in sight,<br>
Cow's gentle head, rabbit ears so fine,<br>
Three blue-green eyes gleam, but oh, the stench divine!<br>
Night's cacophony, its righteous ear-piercing call,<br>
Keeps villagers awake, if one then all.<br><br>

Enter our heroine, with spirit bright,<br>
Playful and mischievous, in the moon's pale light,<br>
She seeks to protect her home dear,<br>
With a plan to drive the beast away, no fear!<br>
No traps or harm, just wit and guile,<br>
To outsmart the creature, with a gentle smile.<br><br>

Armed with forest knowledge, and a heart so light,<br>
She approaches the beast, on this moon-kissed night,<br>
Offering treats, and a gentle, guiding hand,<br>
Dear mishmash friend, she says, let's find a new land.<br><br>

The beast, surprised by kindness, true and rare,<br>
Follows the girl, with an awkward, lovable air.<br>
Beyond the forest edge, a gentle river's flow,<br>
Together they wander, through Diurnoct's glow.<br>
Until the creature finds a new home, <br>
Far, far away from the villager's moan.<br><br>

Beaming a grin, our heroine returns, with victory and delight,<br>
Her heart full of cheer, in the silent, moonlit night.<br>
Now the village, so sleepy, may rest its weary head,<br>
Bearing eyes, so heavy, may finaly go to bed!<br>
For though the beast was bothersome, and quite a test,<br>
Her heartwarming solution, proved kindness is always best.<br><br>
