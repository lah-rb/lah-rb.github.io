description: "
Tira is one of many mechanics employed to build and maintain high atmosphere launch platforms connecting to blue-red shift
columns close to Kipukas space. Tira is exemplary, however. Not only does she take it upon her self to learn the 
complete plans of a project before execution, but she obsessively tailors her personal gear to fit its most miniscule details.
This has resulted in a vast collection of fantastic devices which she employs with marvelous skill. 
As she works, the movements between her body and gear blend flawlessly. Whether positioning herself precariously to reach the bolt
that no one else is daring enough to fasten, unabashedly jumping from scaffold to scaffold to be the first on the next project
(or in the lunch line), or fending off would be pirates she presents a kind of intangible grace. Because of this, her colleagues
often say she is an angel with talent instead of wings.
