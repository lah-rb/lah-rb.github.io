description: "
Many great civilizations have been built. Of these most, if not all, fall from grace in one aspect or another eventually to be torn down, or 
captured by means of force, coercion, or conviction. Each civilization carries a spirit of its people that becomes severed in the demise of the
people. Oly, one such spirit, carries the burden of the memory and tragedies inflected upon his birth place. He dons cloth representing the 
fluidity of his culture, a golden bracelet and anklet representing the bindings of his ruler, and bares a golden vine symbolically pulling
him from the heavens to the place of his creation.
<br><br>
Oly's power steams directly from the influence of his society, which has largely been forgotten. So, he gives of him self the woe and tear for drink.
Slowly draining the essence of himself and the last hope of his people, in a desperate attempt to dredge up their life for the memory of modern peoples.
Doing this, he is wholly aware of the possibility of giving into his own demise. 
"

play_style: "
If oly wins a keal means bout, the competing soul drank his potion and becomes overwhelmed by the tragedy of his people, they are immobile and unable to defend next turn.
If the territory is captured during this turn, they become imprisoned until the territory is recaptured.
