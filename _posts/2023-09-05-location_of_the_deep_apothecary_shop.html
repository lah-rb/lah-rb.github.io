'I know a little place you can get that' says the woodland sprite. 'Only the initiated
may know its location. A blood pact is required.' I wondered for a minute then asked
'If I must enter a blood pact to know its location where do I go?' As the question slipped
my lips a lurching sensation overcame my torso. I felt stiffness propagate through my body as a
dagger lay stuck into my back. The sprite continued 'Its less of a question of where rather than
when...'
