Don't mess with this one. He tries to appear friendly, but fails in doing so. He
deals cards from another plane that are said to bind your fate, yet only he can know the fate you choose.
"
play_style: "
Once introduced to the kipuka take your opponent's hand and combine it with your
hand then shuffle. Lay all six cards face down. Take a card, then let your opponent
take a card and repeat until you and your opponent have the same number of cards 
you each began the turn holding. Play the cards as your own.
