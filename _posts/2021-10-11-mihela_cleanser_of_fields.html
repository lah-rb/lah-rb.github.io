description: "Mihela was the first of the fairies to be produced. She despised
having come from no lineage. As she was studied, her hatred of the situation grew, and
she became obsessed with creating or finding a past and grew fascinated with the
concept of death. In death, the past only concerned the memory of the living.
After eventually becoming released, she began to frequent graveyards, turning
over every headstone, so to say, to dig up the past of those left without a future.
She began to encounter people who called her a grave robber. As such, run-ins
with the law became frequent. She used her limited flight capability in the dead
of night to evade those who misjudged her, but eventually she was
captured. Under protest, she was sent to the war of the first kipuka to
assist in managing the battlefield's dead once the fighting passed. The
more she killed and buried, her obsession grew. She began to wear clothes with
greater eccentricity that honored the death that surrounded her. Some began to
call her the mistress of death."
