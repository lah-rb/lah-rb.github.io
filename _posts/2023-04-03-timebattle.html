description: "The days grew long and the king looked longingly out into a city, once grand,
now in dismay. His pride goaded him into challenging an enemy he knew, in his heart,
he could not beat. He watched his wife parish, children leave, and town crumble.
Though he and his noble steed slayed the dragon of his youth, this king's folly
left ruin where once a society thrived. The dawn broke, and he prepared for his
last journey beyond the walls. His enemy knew of the surrender long before word
spread among his people. As he traveled, the former king remembered how to act and
where to go. Since he was a mere boy, he was groomed for the journey. Perhaps the
successor, should there be a successor, lead his kingdom away from the demons among the walls."
