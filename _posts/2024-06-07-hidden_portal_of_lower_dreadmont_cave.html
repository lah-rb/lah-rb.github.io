description: "
Hiding deep within caverns of Dreadmont exists a gateway whence great power dwells. Few creatures 
have the means to survive the journey through the disorienting web-work passages, the ensnaring crevices, and 
sudden cliffs to reach the lower cave system. In the lower system there are fewer passages to follow, but 
horizontal points of rest become scarce. New treacherous obstacles such as rarified air displaced by toxic gases and water filled 
chambers join the effort to stave off explorers. Somewhere, miles below the surface, stands a tall cavern normally waiting in pitch black.
However, when a skilled spelunker finds the cave with a heart open to receive the power and consequence dwelling beyond, a searing light 
emerges. Should the weary soul pass the final life binding test, they will find themselves past through the gate in a state beyond contestation.
