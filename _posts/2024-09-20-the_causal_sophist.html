description: "
'Like many things, it is a manner of causal findings. The infinite space in the universe facilitates the requirements of the stars.
Therefore, the stars are present. If the needs of the start were unmet in this universe, surely our children would not be able
to take them in their wonderous gaze each and every night.'

Teachings like these make up the core foundation of the philosophy of the Causal Sophist. Generally,
the reach of her ponderings is far too great for her meager, human understanding. Still, these museings take many
lesser minds to places they could not dare to reach on their own. In every right, she is a genious, so few can spot
the subtle flaws present in her propositions. Those who can, however, are left feeling like not much has actually
been presented. Still, both her and her most devoted followers are claimed to possess mastery of supernatural powers
stimming from her other worldly oneness with the expansive minds flowing through the universe.

She turns cenozoic and astral souls occuping the same space into magic souls while they share said space.
This effect is always active and applies to all players.
