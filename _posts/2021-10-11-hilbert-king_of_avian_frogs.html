description: "Hilbert started life out as any other avian frog; living it up in
the tree tops among the bogs of their small remote kipuka. He rose to the
position of king not by might in war, clever politics, or birth right. Instead,
hilbert bred with his colony prolifically earning him the most estemed position.
Under his reign, the avian frogs were ushered into unparalled prosperity thanks
to the establishment of bug farms. The staff he holds has been passed down throgh
countless kings. The most devoted of the frogs believe it harnesses the mystery
and power of the moon."
