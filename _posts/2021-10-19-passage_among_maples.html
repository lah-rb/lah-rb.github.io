play_style: "Extends the movement range of souls that start in this territory by 1.
During the night, while you control the territory this card is affixed to,
instead of your normal hand refresh, you may add one honey card to your hand
from either player's discard or your deck.
Reshuffle your deck if you take this action."
description: "The passage through the maples is a ceremony held once every three
years to symbolize the renewal of the life cycle of the bees. The culture responsible
for holding the ceremony uses a traditional economy through their LACA division, which
is primarily focused on the production of honey. Passing under the arch is a regular
occurence for the souls in this area, as they do so while taking stock to a larger
port down river. The arch was built up many years ago and is considered a reminder
that they live among the home of their ancestors."
