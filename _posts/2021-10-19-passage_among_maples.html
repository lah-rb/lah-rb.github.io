description: "The passage through the maples is a ceremony held once every three
years to sympolize the renewal of the life cycle of the bees. The culture responsible
for holding the ceremony holds a traditional economy through their LACA division which
is primarily focused on the production of honey. Passing under the arch is a regular
occurance for the souls in this area as they do so while taking stock to a larger
port down river. The arch was built up many years ago and is considered a reminder
that they live among the home of their ancestors."
