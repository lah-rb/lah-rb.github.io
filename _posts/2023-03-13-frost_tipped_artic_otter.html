description: "These creatures were created to harvest a special oil with an extreme smoke point.
This oil secretes in large amounts from glandular pockets in the animal's skin and forms a cold
waxy substance on its fur. While this creature was designed for humane harvest, many have started
acquiring a taste for its fatty flesh."

Cenozoic archetypal gene. Can donate 2 keal means at the cost of 1 keal means to
itself."
