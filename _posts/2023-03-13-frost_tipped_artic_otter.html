description: "These creatures were created to harvest a special oil with an extreme smoke point.
This oil secretes in large amounts from glandular pockets in the animal's skin and forms a cold
waxy substance on its fur. While this creature was designed for humane harvest, many have started
acquiring a taste for its fatty flesh."
play_style: "Your opponent chooses a letter for you, and you choose for them.
Name a fat that begins with your letter. Compare the smoke points of the fats.
The higher smoke point wins the match."
