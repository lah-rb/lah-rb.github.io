description: "
Do we dream of a peaceful passing? No, most of us don't. If fact, bring up the
thought of parashing and many of use fill with dread and fear. Woe so fills our
hearts that we plead with whom ever may be there to spare us just another day.
We then fill that day with normal activities, until we settle and forget once
again the fragility of our existance. Others embrace the thought of mortality,
using the idea to spur on decisions our conscious is not well fond of. You only
live once after all. The fact is, no matter if we display our ignorance of death
by forgetting its existance or down playing its possibility, we should all long
for a peaceful passing. One where our soul can become whole and move beyond our
past. Here lies the sad truth, no amout of contemplation, meditation, or foresight
will ever guarentee an ideal death. Evil lurks to keep us shackeled, bewildered, and
searching in this world. Keeping a ghostly presence here to echo the voice and
intention of this evil. Still others seek to guide the lost, to help them find
the peace they have become in such dire need of. Their forms and trails may show
different light, but to the unease of such orbs they act as their white knight.
