description: "
Living on most of the world's continents, wolfs have fascinated people for centuries adapting their way into our hearts and homes. 
While most zoologists know the wolf's howl as a means of communication among their pack, some decided this was not enough. 
They sought to create the god our ancestors imagined them to be, gods of the night under the moon. Unlike normal gray wolves, these 
fervently praise the moon with their howls, thereby raising their collective mental state in exultance.
