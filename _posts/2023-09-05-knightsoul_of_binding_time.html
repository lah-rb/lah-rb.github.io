description: "
In search for the revival of the ways of old, a small group of zealots held ferverent
meetings in order to connect with spirits holding the lives they desired. Hundreds of years
passed with little but enormous ancestral faith to show for their desires, calls, and pleas.
None lost hope, ardent and steadfast that one day they would stand rewarded. One fridiged night,
their leader woke from a trancendental, all consuming dream, claiming to have met the one they sought.
'A knight covered in blue. Bound by all that has past at the foot, one who sees what has never passed, and encompasses
all that is now. It came. We have always known of the higher society; now I have seen it.' Many others
now claim visits from the Knightsoul, and some say it has passed them edicts. While the
existance of the Knightsoul hasn't been confirmed, the people's passionate belief won't be denied.
