description: "
A battle between ancestry and heritage rages. In attempts to prove
their hold on the future, fathers and sons spill the blood of each.
The knowledge of what builds the future, our present, dissipates from the warriors'
conscious. In its place rises the focus to triumph, skewing the edges of internal
right and wrong. Before the future is lost to those with brave and foolish hearts,
angels intervened with pleas for mercy. Selflessly running between the projectiles,
their wives and daughters had called back the warriors' hearts to reality. The first
daughter to demonstrate her courage, Sabina, died under bloody cloth. In her honor,
a temple and a steeple were constructed upon the spot of her death. As often happens
to grand buildings over the passing times, they become repurposed to suit the modern culture.
In this case, Sabina's temple found bustling life as it transformed to its region's
largest emporium. While luring to tourists, the emporium proves a glorious nest
for scammers and thieves. Some find hidden jewels, archaeological treasures, or
historical tomes while others find rubbish, malice, and sometimes death. Still,
It has been said that when one casts their gaze to the sky beyond the vaulted glass
they will feel overwhelmed with the courage of Sabina.
