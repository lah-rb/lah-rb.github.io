description: "Tejas is one of the many private offshoots from the SIS project. This
particular mechanical marvel continuously attempts to improve his own chassis. 'Bigger
sprockets here, lighter rod there, auxiliary power in case of failure all around' he says.
Inspite or because of his categorical engineering knowledge, he often stumps himself
and runs around in pieces for days, even sometimes weeks!"
play_style: "An expert engineer, Tejas heals one keal means per turn from cards which are
Mechanical, Algorithmic, or Entropic. If Tejas does not fix anything this turn
he becomes bored and breaks himself. Tejas can fix himself if he does not fix anything
next turn. When broken, Roll one D6 for defense. When not broken, Roll two D6 in defense."
