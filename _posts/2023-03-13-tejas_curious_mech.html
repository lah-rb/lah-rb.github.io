description: "Tejas is one of the many private offshoots from the SIS project. This
particular mechanical marvel continuously attempts to improve his own chassis. 'Bigger
sprockets here, lighter rod there, auxiliary power in case of failure all around' he says.
Inspite or because of his categorical engineering knowledge, he often stumps himself
and runs around in pieces for days, even sometimes weeks!"
play_style: "An expert engineer, Tejas heals one keal means per turn for all
Mechanical, Algorithmic, or Entropic archetypal gene souls in the same territory. If Tejas does not fix anything this turn
he becomes bored and breaks himself. Tejas can fix himself if he does not fix anything
next turn. When broken, Tajas is downed. Tajas breaks or fixes himself at the start of the cycle."
