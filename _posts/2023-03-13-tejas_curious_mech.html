description: "Tejas is one of the many private offshoots from the SIS project. This
particular mechanical marvel continuously attempts to improve his own chassis. 'Bigger
sprockets here, lighter rod there, auxiliary power in case of failure all around' he says.
In spite or because of his categorical engineering knowledge, he often stumps himself
and runs around in pieces for days, even sometimes weeks!"
play_style: "An expert engineer, Tejas heals one keal means per turn for all
Mechanical, Algorithmic, or Entropic archetypal gene souls in the same uncontended territory. If Tejas does not perform any actions this turn
he becomes bored and breaks himself. When broken Tajas, must fix himself before moving or fixing other souls.
Tajas breaks or fixes himself at the start of the cycle."
