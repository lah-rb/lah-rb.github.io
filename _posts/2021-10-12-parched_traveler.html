description: "After traveling the sand ruins created by weapons of mass destruction,
researchers theorized that one would surly die if they attempted to cross by foot
alone. They then developed a huminoid form as close to death as possible. It requires
almost no water nor food and endures heat increadibly well. While it looks like
a man, this species is not intellegent nor is it sentiant. It was designed to take
simple commands well. They are used as a scare tactic in war and a less than reliable
scout. Despite their looks, they are easy to care for and make great pets for children."
