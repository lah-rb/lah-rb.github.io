description: "After traveling the sand ruins created by weapons of mass destruction,
researchers theorized that one would surly die if they attempted to cross by foot
alone. They then developed a huminoid form as close to death as possible. It requires
almost no water nor food and endures heat incredibly well. While it looks like
a man, this species is not intelligent nor is it sentient. In fact, it can't even breed.
It was designed to take simple commands well. They are used as a scare tactic in
war and a less than reliable scout. Despite their looks, they are easy to care
for and make great pets for children."
play_style: "Rolls 2 D6, can move when downed. If parched traveler is attacked
with no keal means, flip a coin. If heads the parched traveler is defeated."
