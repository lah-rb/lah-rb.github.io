Privacy Policy

We value your privacy and take it very seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when accessing our website's QR code scanning feature ("Feature"). By using our Feature, you consent to our privacy practices as described in this policy.

Information Collection

We only collect data from your device's camera when you explicitly activate the Feature. This data includes information encoded within QR codes (such as URLs), but we do not collect or store any other personal information from your camera stream or device.

Information Use

We use this information solely for the purpose of providing the Feature, allowing users to scan QR codes quickly and easily without leaving our website. This information is not used for any other purpose.

Information Protection

We take appropriate technical measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no data transmission over the internet or electronic storage method can be guaranteed 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or collect from your device's camera. You use our Feature at your own risk.

Third-Party Services

We may use third-party services (such as jsQR) to provide the Feature. These third parties have their own privacy policies that apply when using their services. Please refer to their policies for more information on their privacy practices.

Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 years of age without parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete such information as soon as possible. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13 years of age, please contact us immediately.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "effective date" at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy whenever you use our Feature to stay informed about our information practices and your privacy choices.
