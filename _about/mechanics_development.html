          Game mechanics rest at the core of any game, obviously. Not every game has a clear way to evolve
          their mechanics over time, though. In classic table top games, such as chess, by the time rules were
          internationally
          agreed upon they had already be codified over years of play slowly morphing from its ancestral roots. Others,
          like tik-tak-toe, present such a simple premise any modification results in the creation of a whole new game.
          However, for a complex modern game like Kipukas, we live and die based on our ability to produce mechanics
          which
          not only add novelty to the gaming world, but also our ability to react to how these play out in the wild. At
          Kipukas,
          we store mechanics 100% digitally, despite being a table top game. This gives us the ability to update card
          and game
          rules as needed. Additionally, we use the following system to clarify our confidence in their mechanical
          stability, so to say.
        </p>
        <ul class="text-lg">
          <li>
            <strong>α mechanics:</strong>
            <p class="ml-4 text-sm">These mechanics are highly experimental and not considered for use in officially
              sanctioned events. Their use is encouraged if the user is interested in helping the game develop further;
              otherwise, they should be ignored.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>β mechanics:</strong>
            <p class="ml-4 text-sm">These mechanics are experimental. They are allowed in officially sanctioned events;
              however, they are not guaranteed a sustained lifetime in the events. Their behavior is mostly firm, but
              maybe adjusted as more is learned about them.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>γ mechanics:</strong>
            <p class="ml-4 text-sm">These mechanics are thoroughly vetted and can be considered an integral part of the
              Kipukas rule book. The behavior is unlikely to change and if it does it will be minor or trivial.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ω mechanics:</strong>
            <p class="ml-4 text-sm">These mechanics have reached the end of their life cycle and are no longer accepted
              in officially sanctioned events. However, players are welcome to use these mechanics in their own
              gameplay. If interest is high enough, the mechanics may be reintroduced as α mechanics.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="italic text-sm mt-2">
          <b>α</b> inherits from <b>ω</b> or original thought | <b>γ</b> inherits from <b>β</b> | <b>ω</b> inherits from
          <b>α</b> and <b>β</b>
        </p>
        <p class="italic text-sm mt-2">
          At the Kipukas launch, all rules mechanics should be considered <b>β</b> and card mechanics considered
          <b>α</b>. As
          a versioning system is implemented on the binder, and as we gather game play feedback, we will report the
          state of
          mechanics on each card in the binder.
        </p>

        <h2 class="z-20 mt-6">Dynamic Play Style:</h2>

        <p class="ml-4 text-sm">
          The development of mechanics that have different results given similar inputs is encouraged.
          While this may sound confusing, think about Dungeons and Dragons style gameplay where the dungeon master is
          employed to decide if a certain action is acceptable to occur.
          This is intended to reward clever actions and in-the-moment thinking as well as assist in the creation of
          new, more robust game mechanics. When discovered in official games, these could become α mechanics.
        </p>
        <h2 class="z-20 mt-6">Rule Guarantees:</h2>
        <p class="ml-4 text-sm">
          <ul>
            <li>No card will <b>EVER</b> be banned from game play at any officially sanctioned event</li>
            <li>Synchronicity between cards will never be planned and must be discovered by players</li>
            <li>Card play is designed to be stable (over the long run, probably not at launch :)</li>
            <li>We won't produce new card mechanics exclusively to outdate previous releases</li>
          </ul>
