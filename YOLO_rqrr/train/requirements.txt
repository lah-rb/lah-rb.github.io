# YOLOv12 training & export
# Install: pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Note: Use the sunsmarterjie/yolov12 repo (not ultralytics) for
# correct YOLOv12 implementation. Their repo IS ultralytics-compatible
# but fixes training stability and memory issues.
#
# GPU: FlashAttention is optional. Training works without it.
# ONNX export does NOT require FlashAttention.
