      Welcome to the Kipukas card binder! Here you will find our fullest collection of
      cards ready to browse to aid you in planning your next great strategy. Additionally,
      this space allows players to access their card's data via the qr links on the back of
      every Kipukas card. This offer's players several advantages over writing play data on
      the card itself.

    <ul class="z-20 w-5/6 md:w-3/6 place-self-center py-5">
      <li class="py-2 italic">Card art presents in full focus: no ugly text boxes to get in the way</li>
      <li class="py-2 italic">Legibility: no longer are lengthy card mechanics printed in 1pt font</li>
      <li class="py-2 italic">Updateability: cards will receive mechanics updates as needed, use your favorites forever!</li>
    </ul>

      Some people have stated worry that this setup will be used to enforce a pay to play
      scenario, but this is the opposite of why the cards are set up in this manner.
      I too became tired of my favorite games moving towards a pay to play mentality.
      Instead, we seek to build out a community of independent players, artists, and game devs
      dedicated to producing the most unique, collaborative board game created to date.
      So, you have my personal guarantee that kipukas.cards will always be free (as in beer) to access.
      If there ever comes a time when I personally can't further this project, this site
      will be made completely open source. - Luke A. Hayes - Kipukas Founder
